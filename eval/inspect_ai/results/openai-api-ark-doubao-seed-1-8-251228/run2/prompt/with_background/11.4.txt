PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Given $j$ and $d$, write a function that returns a standard basis vector $|j\rangle$ in $d$-dimensional space. If $d$ is given as an int and $j$ is given as a list $[j_1,j_2\cdots,j_n]$, then return the tensor product $|j_1\rangle|j_2\rangle\cdots|j_n\rangle$ of $d$-dimensional basis vectors. If $d$ is also given as a list $[d_1,d_2,\cdots,d_n]$, return $|j_1\rangle|j_2\rangle\cdots|j_n\rangle$ as tensor product of $d_1$, $d_2$, ..., and $d_n$ dimensional basis vectors.
Background
A standard basis vector $|j\rangle$ in $d$ dimensional space is
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
with a 1 on the $j$-th position and 0's everywhere else. Tensor products of two vectors are given by the Kronecker product
\begin{align}
|a\rangle|b\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix} \otimes \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1b_1 \\ a_1b_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_1b_n \\ a_2b_1 \\ a_2b_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_2b_n \\ a_nb_1 \\ a_nb_2 \vdots \\ a_nb_n \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

Using the ket function, write a function that generates a bipartite maximally entangled state where both parties are encoded by $m$-rail encoding.
Background
The $m$-rail encoding produces the state
$$
|\psi_m\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}(\underbrace{|00\cdots01\rangle}_{m\text{ qubits}}\underbrace{|00\cdots01\rangle}_{m\text{ qubits}} + \underbrace{|00\cdots10\rangle}_{m\text{ qubits}}\underbrace{|00\cdots10\rangle}_{m\text{ qubits}} + \cdots + \underbrace{|10\cdots00\rangle}_{m\text{ qubits}}\underbrace{|10\cdots00\rangle}_{m\text{ qubits}}).

Write a function that returns the tensor product of an arbitrary number of matrices/vectors.

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function that applies the Kraus operators of a quantum channel on subsystems of a state with tensor function. If sys and dim are given as None, then the channel acts on the entire system of the state rho. If sys is given as a list, then the channel is applied to each subsystem in that list, and the dimension of each subsystem also must be given.
Background
The action of quantum channels can be written in terms of its Kraus representation:
$$ \mathcal{N}(\rho) = \sum_i K_i \rho K_i^\dagger $$
where $\sum_i K_i^\dagger K_i = \mathbb{I}$. The $K_i$'s are called the Kraus operators of the channel $\mathcal{N}$. If the quantum channel acts on the $i$-th subsystem of $\rho$, then the Kraus operators has the form $\mathbb{I}\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{I}\otimes K_i\otimes\mathbb{I}\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{I}$, where $K_i$ acts on the $i$-th subsystem and the identity acts on the remaining systems.

def apply_channel(K, rho, sys=None, dim=None):
    '''Applies the channel with Kraus operators in K to the state rho on
    systems specified by the list sys. The dimensions of the subsystems of
    rho are given by dim.
    Inputs:
    K: list of 2d array of floats, list of Kraus operators
    rho: 2d array of floats, input density matrix
    sys: list of int or None, list of subsystems to apply the channel, None means full system
    dim: list of int or None, list of dimensions of each subsystem, None means full system
    Output:
    matrix: output density matrix of floats

        return matrix
