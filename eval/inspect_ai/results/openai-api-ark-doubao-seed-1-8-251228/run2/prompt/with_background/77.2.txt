PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Wrap to periodic boundaries
Implementing a Python function named `wrap`. This function should apply periodic boundary conditions to the coordinates of a particle inside a cubic simulation box.
Background:
To implement PBC, the unit cell is surrounded by translated copies in all directions to approximate an infinitely large system. When one molecule diffuses across the boundary of the simulation box it reappears on the opposite side. So each molecule always interacts with its neighbours even though they may be on opposite sides of the simulation box


def wrap(r, L):
    '''Apply periodic boundary conditions to a vector of coordinates r for a cubic box of size L.
    Parameters:
    r : The (x, y, z) coordinates of a particle.
    L (float): The length of each side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    coord: numpy 1d array of floats, the wrapped coordinates such that they lie within the cubic box.
    '''
    r_np = np.asarray(r, dtype=np.float64)
    coord = np.mod(r_np, L)
    return coord


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Minimum Image Distance Function

Implementing Python function named `dist` that calculates the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
Background:
The function should implement the minimum image convention, which is used in molecular dynamics simulations to consider the shortest distance between periodic images of particles.

def dist(r1, r2, L):
    '''Calculate the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
    Parameters:
    r1 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the first atom.
    r2 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the second atom.
    L (float): The length of the side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    float: The minimum image distance between the two atoms.
    '''

    return distance

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

import math

import scipy as sp
from scipy.constants import  Avogadro

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
