PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Each spin site `(i, j)` has 4 nearest neighbors: `(i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1)`. To ensure periodic boundary conditions, write a Python function that returns a list of 4 nearest neighbors of a spin at site `(i, j)` in a lattice of dimension `(N, N)`.



def neighbor_list(site, N):
    '''Return all nearest neighbors of site (i, j).
    Args:
        site (Tuple[int, int]): site indices
        N (int): number of sites along each dimension
    Return:
        list: a list of 2-tuples, [(i_left, j_left), (i_above, j_above), (i_right, j_right), (i_below, j_below)]
    '''
    i, j = site
    # Calculate each neighbor with periodic boundary conditions using modulo
    left = (i, (j - 1) % N)
    above = ((i - 1) % N, j)
    right = (i, (j + 1) % N)
    below = ((i + 1) % N, j)
    nn_wrap = [left, above, right, below]
    return nn_wrap

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.
