PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a function calculating second order derivatives using center symmetric scheme with second order accuracy. Using ghost cells with values equal to nearest cell on the boundary.
Background:
Centered second order differentiate operator:

$$
f^{\prime \prime}(x): \quad\{f(x+\Delta x)-2 f(x)+f(x-\Delta x)\} / \Delta x^2
$$


def second_diff(target, u, dx):
    '''Inputs:
    target : Target cell index, int
    u      : Approximated solution value, array of floats with minimum length of 5
    Outputs:
    deriv  : Second order derivative of the given target cell, float
    '''
    n = len(u)
    u_curr = u[target]
    
    # Determine left value (handle left boundary ghost cell)
    if target == 0:
        u_prev = u[0]
    else:
        u_prev = u[target - 1]
    
    # Determine right value (handle right boundary ghost cell)
    if target == n - 1:
        u_next = u[-1]
    else:
        u_next = u[target + 1]
    
    # Calculate second order derivative using the centered scheme
    deriv = (u_next - 2 * u_curr + u_prev) / (dx ** 2)
    
    return deriv

Write a function performing first order strang splitting at each time step
Background
The accuracy of the splitting method discussed in the section on Ordinary Operator Splitting for ODEs can
be enhanced from $O(\Delta t)$ to $O(\Delta t^2)$ by employing Strang splitting.
This method involves taking a half-step with the $f_0$ operator, a full step with the $f_1$ operator,
and then another half-step with the $f_0$ operator.
Over a time interval $\Delta t$, the algorithm can be expressed as follows.

\begin{aligned}
\frac{d \hat{u}}{d t} & =f_0\left(\hat{u}\right), \quad \hat{u}\left(t_n\right)=u\left(t_n\right), \quad t \in\left[t_n, t_n+\frac{1}{2} \Delta t\right] \\
\frac{d \tilde{u}}{d t} & =f_1\left(\tilde{u}\right), \quad \tilde{u}\left(t_n\right)=\hat{u}\left(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}\right), \quad t \in\left[t_n, t_n+\Delta t\right] \\
\frac{d \check{u}}{d t} & =f_0\left(\check{u}\right), \quad \check{u}\left(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\right)=\tilde{u}\left(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}\right), \quad t \in\left[t_{n+\frac{1}{2}} \Delta t, t_n+\Delta t\right]
\end{aligned}


def Strang_splitting(u, dt, dx, alpha):
    n = len(u)
    # Step 1: Half-step with f0 (diffusion operator) using explicit Euler
    u_half_f0 = np.copy(u)
    for target in range(n):
        # Calculate second derivative using the pre-defined second_diff function
        u_xx = second_diff(target, u, dx)
        # Update solution for half-step of diffusion
        u_half_f0[target] = u[target] + (dt / 2) * alpha * u_xx
    
    # Step 2: Full step with f1 (operator placeholder - adjust if f1 is defined)
    # For this implementation, we assume f1 is a placeholder (e.g., zero operator)
    u_full_f1 = np.copy(u_half_f0)
    
    # Step 3: Half-step with f0 (diffusion operator) again using explicit Euler
    u_check = np.copy(u_full_f1)
    for target in range(n):
        # Calculate second derivative using the updated solution from step 2
        u_xx = second_diff(target, u_full_f1, dx)
        # Update solution for final half-step of diffusion
        u_check[target] = u_full_f1[target] + (dt / 2) * alpha * u_xx
    
    return u_check
