PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Use the velocity-Verlet algorithm to integrate the velocity and position of the oscillator over time $\Delta t$, assuming the oscillator is only subject to the harmonic restoring force.
Background
The velocity-Verlet algorithm updates the velocity and position as
$$\begin{array}{l}
x(t + \Delta t) = x(t) + v(t)\Delta t + \frac{{F(t)}}{{2m}}\Delta {t^2},\\
v(t + \Delta t) = v(t) + \frac{{F(t + \Delta t) + F(t)}}{{2m}}\Delta t.
\end{array}$$
The algorithm can implemented as follows:
we first update the velocity at $t+\Delta t/2$ as
$$v(t + \frac{{\Delta t}}{2}) = v(t) + \frac{{F(t)}}{m}\frac{{\Delta t}}{2},$$
then update the position as
$$x(t + \Delta t) = x(t) + v(t + \frac{{\Delta t}}{2}) \cdot \Delta t,$$
finally update the velocity at $t+\Delta t/2$ as
$$v(t + \Delta t) = v(t + \frac{{\Delta t}}{2}) + \frac{{F(t + \Delta t)}}{m}\cdot\frac{{\Delta t}}{2}.$$
The force at $t$ and $t+\Delta t$ is given by $- m\omega _0^2x(t)$ and $- m\omega _0^2x(t + \Delta t)$
