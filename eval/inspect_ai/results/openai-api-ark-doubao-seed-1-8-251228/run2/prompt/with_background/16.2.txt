PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a function to generate a symmetric matrix with increasing values along its diagonal.  All elements in the matrix should be modified based on the product of a normally distributed random number generated by numpy and an input given by the user. Symmetrize the matrix by taking the average of the sum of the matrix and its tranpose.



def init_matrix(dim, noise):
    '''Generate a symmetric matrix with increasing values along its diagonal.
    Inputs:
    - dim: The dimension of the matrix (int).
    - noise: Noise level (float).
    Output:
    - A: a 2D array where each element is a float, representing the symmetric matrix.
    '''
    # Create base matrix with increasing diagonal elements (1, 2, ..., dim)
    base = np.diag(np.arange(1, dim + 1))
    # Generate noise matrix with elements as noise multiplied by standard normal samples
    noise_mat = noise * np.random.randn(dim, dim)
    # Combine base matrix with noise
    M = base + noise_mat
    # Symmetrize the matrix by averaging with its transpose
    A = (M + M.T) / 2
    return A


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function to implement the Davidson's method. The user should be able to set the convergence threshold and the number of eigenvalues to be solved.
Background
Davidson's method:
  * Initialize : Define $n$ vectors $b = \{b_1,...b_n\}$ with $n$ the dimension of $A$
  * Iterate : loop till convergence
    project the matrix on the subspace $A_p = b^TAb$
    2. Diagonalize the projected matrix : $A_pv_i = \lambda_i v_i$ 
    3. Compute the residue vector : $r_i = Abv_i - \lambda_i bv_i$
    4. Compute correction vector : $q_i = - r_i / (\mathrm{diag}(A) - \lambda_i)$
    5. Append the correction vector to $b$ : $b = \{b_1,...,b_n,q_i\}$

def davidson_solver(matrixA, num_eigenvalues, threshold):
    '''Implements the Davidson algorithm to compute the first few eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix.
    Inputs:
    - matrixA: Symmetric matrix (2D array of float).
    - num_eigenvalues: Number of lowest eigenvalues to compute (int).
    - threshold: Convergence threshold for the algorithm (float).
    Output:
    - current_eigenvalues: computed eigenvalues (1D array of float).
    '''

    return current_eigenvalues

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
