PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Wrap to periodic boundaries
Implementing a Python function named `wrap`. This function should apply periodic boundary conditions to the coordinates of a particle inside a cubic simulation box.
Background:
To implement PBC, the unit cell is surrounded by translated copies in all directions to approximate an infinitely large system. When one molecule diffuses across the boundary of the simulation box it reappears on the opposite side. So each molecule always interacts with its neighbours even though they may be on opposite sides of the simulation box


def wrap(r, L):
    '''Apply periodic boundary conditions to a vector of coordinates r for a cubic box of size L.
    Parameters:
    r : The (x, y, z) coordinates of a particle.
    L (float): The length of each side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    coord: numpy 1d array of floats, the wrapped coordinates such that they lie within the cubic box.
    '''
    r_np = np.asarray(r, dtype=np.float64)
    coord = np.mod(r_np, L)
    return coord

Minimum Image Distance Function

Implementing Python function named `dist` that calculates the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
Background:
The function should implement the minimum image convention, which is used in molecular dynamics simulations to consider the shortest distance between periodic images of particles.


def dist(r1, r2, L):
    '''Calculate the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
    Parameters:
    r1 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the first atom.
    r2 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the second atom.
    L (float): The length of the side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    float: The minimum image distance between the two atoms.
    '''
    r1_np = np.asarray(r1, dtype=np.float64)
    r2_np = np.asarray(r2, dtype=np.float64)
    delta = r1_np - r2_np
    # Apply minimum image convention to each component of the difference vector
    delta_mic = np.mod(delta + L / 2, L) - L / 2
    # Compute Euclidean norm of the corrected difference vector
    distance = np.linalg.norm(delta_mic)
    return distance

Minimum Image Vector Function

Implementing Python function named `dist_v` that calculates the minimum image vector between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
Background:
The function should implement the minimum image convention, which is used in molecular dynamics simulations to consider the shortest distance between periodic images of particles.


def dist_v(r1, r2, L):
    '''Calculate the minimum image vector between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
    Parameters:
    r1 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the first atom.
    r2 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the second atom.
    L (float): The length of the side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    numpy 1d array of floats: The minimum image vector between the two atoms.
    '''
    r1_np = np.asarray(r1, dtype=np.float64)
    r2_np = np.asarray(r2, dtype=np.float64)
    delta = r1_np - r2_np
    # Apply minimum image convention to each component of the difference vector
    delta_mic = np.mod(delta + L / 2, L) - L / 2
    return delta_mic

Lennard-Jones Potential

Implementing a Python function named `E_ij` to get Lennard-Jones potential with potential well depth epislon that reaches zero at distance sigma between pair of atoms with distance r. which is truncated and shifted to zero at a cutoff distance `rc`.
Background
The Lennard-Jones potential models soft repulsive and attractive (van der Waals) interactions. Hence, the Lennard-Jones potential describes electronically neutral atoms or molecules. The commonly used expression for the Lennard-Jones potential is:

$V^{tr-sh}_{LJ}(r) =
\begin{cases}
V_{LJ}(r)-V_{LJ}(r_c), & \text{if } r < r_c\\
0, & \text{if } r > r_c
\end{cases}
$

$
V_{LJ}(r) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{6} \right].
$

$
V_{LJ}(r_c) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^{6} \right].
$


where r is the distance between two interacting particles, epsilon is the depth of the potential well (usually referred to as 'dispersion energy'), and sigma is the distance at which the particle-particle potential energy V is zero (often referred to as 'size of the particle').

The potential is truncated and shifted at a distance $ r_c $ to ensure the interaction energy becomes zero for $ r > r_c $, simplifying the force computations.


def E_ij(r, sigma, epsilon, rc):
    '''Calculate the combined truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones potential energy between two particles.
    Parameters:
    r (float): The distance between particles i and j.
    sigma (float): The distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    epsilon (float): The depth of the potential well for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    rc (float): The cutoff distance beyond which the potentials are truncated and shifted to zero.
    Returns:
    float: The combined potential energy between the two particles, considering the specified potentials.
    '''
    if r >= rc:
        return 0.0
    
    # Compute Lennard-Jones potential at distance r
    sigma_over_r = sigma / r
    term6 = sigma_over_r ** 6
    term12 = term6 ** 2
    v_lj_r = 4 * epsilon * (term12 - term6)
    
    # Compute Lennard-Jones potential at cutoff distance rc
    sigma_over_rc = sigma / rc
    term6_c = sigma_over_rc ** 6
    term12_c = term6_c ** 2
    v_lj_rc = 4 * epsilon * (term12_c - term6_c)
    
    # Calculate truncated and shifted potential
    E = v_lj_r - v_lj_rc
    return E

Lennard-Jones Force

 Based on Lennard-Jones potential with potential well depth epislon that reaches zero at distance sigma, write a function that calculates the forces between two particles whose three dimensional displacement is r.
Background
To get force, we just use the negative gradiant of Lennard-Jones potential (by definition):

$\vec{F}=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial \vec{r}}=-\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} ; \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} ; \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}\right)$


def f_ij(r, sigma, epsilon, rc):
    '''Calculate the force vector between two particles, considering the truncated and shifted
    Lennard-Jones potential.
    Parameters:
    r (float): The distance between particles i and j.
    sigma (float): The distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    epsilon (float): The depth of the potential well for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    rc (float): The cutoff distance beyond which the potentials are truncated and shifted to zero.
    Returns:
    array_like: The force vector experienced by particle i due to particle j, considering the specified potentials
    '''
    r_np = np.asarray(r, dtype=np.float64)
    r_scalar = np.linalg.norm(r_np)
    
    if r_scalar >= rc:
        return np.zeros_like(r_np)
    
    sigma_over_r = sigma / r_scalar
    sigma_over_r6 = sigma_over_r ** 6
    sigma_over_r12 = sigma_over_r6 ** 2
    
    dV_dr = 4 * epsilon * (-12 * sigma_over_r12 / r_scalar + 6 * sigma_over_r6 / r_scalar)
    force_vector = -dV_dr * (r_np / r_scalar)
    
    return force_vector

Tail Corrections for Energy with LJ

Implementing Python functions named `E_tail` to calculate the tail correction  for a system of particles within a cubic simulation box. This correction accounts for the truncation of the Lennard-Jones potentials at a specific cutoff distance.
Background

In molecular dynamics simulations, long-range interactions are often neglected beyond a cutoff radius $ r_c $. To estimate the contribution of these neglected interactions to the system's energy, tail correction is applied. The energy tail correction per particle is given by:

$
u^{\textbf{tail LJ}}_{i} = \frac{8}{3} \pi N^2 \epsilon \sigma^3 \left[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^9 - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^3 \right]
$

def E_tail(N, L, sigma, epsilon, rc):
    '''Calculate the energy tail correction for a system of particles, considering the truncated and shifted
    Lennard-Jones potential.
    Parameters:
    N (int): The total number of particles in the system.
    L (float): Lenght of cubic box
    r (float): The distance between particles i and j.
    sigma (float): The distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    epsilon (float): The depth of the potential well for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    rc (float): The cutoff distance beyond which the potentials are truncated and shifted to zero.
    Returns:
    float
        The energy tail correction for the entire system (in zeptojoules), considering the specified potentials.
