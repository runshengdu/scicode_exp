PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a Haldane model Hamiltonian on a hexagonal lattice, given the following parameters: wavevector components $k_x$ and $k_y$ (momentum) in the x and y directions, lattice spacing $a$, nearest-neighbor coupling constant $t_1$, next-nearest-neighbor coupling constant $t_2$, phase $\phi$ for the next-nearest-neighbor hopping, and the on-site energy $m$.
Background

We denote $\{\mathbf{a}_i\}$ are the vectors from a B site to its three nearest-neighbor A sites, and $\{\mathbf{b}_i\}$ are next-nearest-neighbor distance vectors, then we have
$$
{\mathbf{a}_1} = (0,a),{\mathbf{a}_2} = (\sqrt 3 a/2, - a/2),{\mathbf{a}_3} = ( - \sqrt 3 a/2, - a/2)\\
{\mathbf{b}_1} = {\mathbf{a}_2} - {\mathbf{a}_3} = (\sqrt 3 a,0),{\mathbf{b}_2} = {\mathbf{a}_3} - {\mathbf{a}_1} = ( - \sqrt 3 a/2, - 3a/2),{\mathbf{b}_3} = {\mathbf{a}_1} - {\mathbf{a}_2} = ( - \sqrt 3 a/2,3a/2)
$$





Then the Haldane model on a hexagonal lattice can be written as
$$H(k) = {d_0}I + {d_1}{\sigma _1} + {d_2}{\sigma _2} + {d_3}{\sigma _3}$$
$${d_0} = 2{t_2}\cos \phi \sum\nolimits_i {\cos (\mathbf{k} \cdot {\mathbf{b}_i})}  = 2{t_2}\cos \phi \left[ {\cos \left( {\sqrt 3 {k_x}a} \right) + \cos \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 + 3{k_y}a/2} \right) + \cos \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - 3{k_y}a/2} \right)} \right]$$
$$
{d_1} = {t_1}\sum\nolimits_i {\cos (\mathbf{k} \cdot {\mathbf{a}_i})}  = {t_1}\left[ {\cos \left( {{k_y}a} \right) + \cos \left( {\sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - {k_y}a/2} \right) + \cos \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - {k_y}a/2} \right)} \right]\\
{d_2} = {t_1}\sum\nolimits_i {\sin (\mathbf{k} \cdot {\mathbf{a}_i})}  = {t_1}\left[ {\sin \left( {{k_y}a} \right) + \sin \left( {\sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - {k_y}a/2} \right) + \sin \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - {k_y}a/2} \right)} \right] \\
{d_3} = m - 2{t_2}\sin \phi \sum\nolimits_i {\sin (\mathbf{k} \cdot {\mathbf{b}_i})}  = m - 2{t_2}\sin \phi \left[ {\sin \left( {\sqrt 3 {k_x}a} \right) + \sin \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 + 3{k_y}a/2} \right) + \sin \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - 3{k_y}a/2} \right)} \right] \\
$$

where $\sigma_i$ are the Pauli matrices and $I$ is the identity matrix.

This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Calculate the Chern number using the Haldane Hamiltonian, given the grid size $\delta$ for discretizing the Brillouin zone in the $k_x$ and $k_y$ directions (assuming the grid sizes are the same in both directions), the lattice spacing $a$, the nearest-neighbor coupling constant $t_1$, the next-nearest-neighbor coupling constant $t_2$, the phase $\phi$ for the next-nearest-neighbor hopping, and the on-site energy $m$.

Here we can discretize the two-dimensional Brillouin zone into grids with step $\delta {k_x} = \delta {k_y} = \delta$. If we define the U(1) gauge field on the links of the lattice as $U_\mu (\mathbf{k}_l) := \frac{\left\langle n(\mathbf{k}_l)\middle|n(\mathbf{k}_l + \hat{\mu})\right\rangle}{\left|\left\langle n(\mathbf{k}_l)\middle|n(\mathbf{k}_l + \hat{\mu})\right\rangle\right|}$, where $\left|n(\mathbf{k}_l)\right\rangle$ is the eigenvector of Hamiltonian at $\mathbf{k}_l$, $\hat{\mu}$ is a small displacement vector in the direction $\mu$ with magnitude $\delta$, and $\mathbf{k}_l$ is one of the momentum space lattice points $l$. The corresponding curvature (flux) becomes

$$
F_{xy}(\mathbf{k}_l) := \ln \left[U_x(\mathbf{k}_l)U_y(\mathbf{k}_l+\hat{x})U_x^{-1}(\mathbf{k}_l+\hat{y})U_y^{-1}(\mathbf{k}_l)\right]
$$

$$$$
and the Chern number of a band can be calculated as

$$
c = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \Sigma_l F_{xy}(\mathbf{k}_l),
$$
where the summation is over all the lattice points $l$. Note that the Brillouin zone of a hexagonal lattice with spacing $a$ can be chosen as a rectangle with $0 \le {k_x} \le k_{x0} = 2\sqrt 3 \pi /(3a),0 \le {k_y} \le k_{y0} = 4\pi /(3a)$.

    Output:
