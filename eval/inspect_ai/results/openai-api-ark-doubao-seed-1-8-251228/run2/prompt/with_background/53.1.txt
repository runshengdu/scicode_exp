PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

The Lotka-Volterra equation for a simple predator-prey system is given by : $$\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta xy$$ $$\frac{dy}{dt} = \beta xy - \gamma y$$ where $x$ is the population of preys and $y$ is the population of predators. Given current porpolations and parameters in Lotka-Volterra equation, perform a single-time update of the Lotka-Volterra equations using the Gillespie algorithm. To sample the time step, use NumPy's exponential distribution directly.
Background
Gillespie Algorithm is a computational method used to simulate the dynamics of stochastic systems as chemical reactions. At one step, each reaction $i$ is associated with a prospensity $a_i$, calculated as the product of the reaction rate and the populations of the species involved. The time until the next reaction occurs is sampled from an exponential distribution with a rate equal to the sum of all propensities, given by the probability density function: $$f(\Delta t) = \frac{1}{a} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta t}{a}\right)$$ where $a = \sum a_i$. At each time step, only one reaction occurs, and the reaction $i$ will be selected with the probability $P_i = \frac{a_i}{\sum a_i}$.

    '''Perform one step of the Gillespie simulation for a predator-prey system.
    Input:
    prey: current population of prey, integer
