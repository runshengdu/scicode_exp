PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

First consider the Schrodinger equation of the form: $(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2-\frac{Z e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r})\psi(\vec{r})=E \psi(\vec{r})$. Write a function to calculate $f(r)$ if we rewrite this Shroedinger equation in the form $u''(r) = f(r)u(r)$. The radii $r\_grid$, energy $energy$ and angular momentum quantum number $l$ will be given as input. Use $Z=1$ in this step.
Background
The Schroedinger equation without the Hartree term is:

\begin{eqnarray}
(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2-\frac{Z e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r})\psi(\vec{r})=E \psi(\vec{r})
\end{eqnarray}

using ansatz:

$\psi(\vec{r}) = Y_{lm}(\hat{r})\; u(r)/r$

and introducing dimensionless variables:

\begin{eqnarray}
x = \frac{r}{r_B}\\
\varepsilon = \frac{E}{E_0}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
&& r_B = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m e^2} \approx 0.529 A\\
&& E_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m r_B^2} == Ry \approx 13.6 eV
\end{eqnarray}

we get the differential equation

\begin{eqnarray}
u''(x)-
\left(\frac{l(l+1)}{x^2}-\frac{2Z}{x}-\varepsilon\right)u(x)=0
\end{eqnarray}

def f_Schrod(energy, l, r_grid):
    '''Input 
    energy: a float
    l: angular momentum quantum number; an int
    r_grid: the radial grid; a 1D array of float
    Output
    f_r: a 1D array of float 
    '''

    return f_r
