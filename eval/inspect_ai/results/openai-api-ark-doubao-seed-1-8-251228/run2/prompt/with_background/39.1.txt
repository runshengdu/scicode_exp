PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Given the refractive indices of the two layers ($n_1$ and $n_2$), and that the layer thickness is set as quarter-wavelength of $\lambda_b$. Provide a function to calculate the phase shift $\phi$ of an incident light with the wavelength $\lambda_{in}$, and therefore the propagate matrix. The output should be a tuple of the matrix element (A,B,C,D).
Background
Phase shift for a specific insident wavelength $\lambda$ is

$$\phi=\frac{\pi \lambda_b}{2 \lambda}$$

where $\lambda_b$ is the Bragg resonant wavelength, which in our case is 980 nm.

The propagate matrix of one period of $n_1$/$n_2$ bilayer is

$$\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{B}_{12} \mathbf{B}_{21}=\left[\begin{array}{ll}A & B \\ C & D\end{array}\right]$$

where

$$\begin{gathered}A=\frac{\left(n_1+n_2\right)^2}{4 n_1 n_2} e^{-2 i \phi}-\frac{\left(n_1-n_2\right)^2}{4 n_1 n_2} \\ \\ B=\frac{n_2^2-n_1^2}{4 n_1 n_2}\left(1-e^{2 i \phi}\right) \\ \\C=\operatorname{conj}(B), \quad D=\operatorname{conj}(A)\end{gathered}$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two different material layers.

def matrix_elements(lambda_in, lambda_b, n1, n2):
    '''Calculates the phase shift and the A/B/C/D matrix factors for a given wavelength.
    Input:
    lambda_in (float): Wavelength of the incident light in nanometers.
    lambda_b (float): Resonant wavelength in nanometers.
    n1 (float): Refractive index of the first material.
    n2 (float): Refractive index of the second material.
    Output:
    matrix (2 by 2 numpy array containing 4 complex numbers): Matrix used in the calculation of the transmission coefficient.
    '''

    return matrix
