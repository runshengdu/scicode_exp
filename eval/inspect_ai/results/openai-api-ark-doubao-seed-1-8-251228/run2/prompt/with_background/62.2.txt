PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Create two classes, `Block` and `EnlargedBlock`, to be used in subsequent steps. Each class contains the following attributes: the length of the block, the size of the block's basis, and an operator dictionary that includes the Hamiltonian and connection operators necessary for the DMRG algorithm. Additionally, each class has a function to print all the attributes in a human-readable format.


def __init__(self, length, basis_size, operator_dict):
    self.length = length
    self.basis_size = basis_size
    self.operator_dict = operator_dict

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

We consider a 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ model without an external magnetic field, assuming isotropic spin interactions and setting $J=1$. We focus on a single-site scenario first. In the basis of spin up/down states $|b_1\rangle=|\!\uparrow\rangle$ and $|b_2\rangle=|\!\downarrow\rangle$, express the spin-z operator$\hat{S}^{z}$, the spin ladder operator $\hat{S}^{+}$ and the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_1$ as 2x2 matrices. This single site  will serve as our initial block for the DMRG algorithm. Construct the initial block using $\hat{H}_1$, $\hat{S}^{z}$ and $\hat{S}^{+}$ with $D=2$ being the dimension of the Hamiltonian at a site
Background
1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ model with isotropic spin interactions is written as:
$$H=J\sum_i\left(\frac{1}{2}(\hat{S}_i^+\hat{S}_{i+1}^-+\hat{S}_i^-\hat{S}_{i+1}^+)+\hat{S}_i^z\hat{S}_{i+1}^z\right)$$
where $J = 1$. On a single-site, the Hamiltonian is zero.

def block_initial(model_d):
    '''Construct the initial block for the DMRG algo. H1, Sz1 and Sp1 is single-site Hamiltonian, spin-z operator
    and spin ladder operator in the form of 2x2 matrix, respectively.
    Input:
    model_d: int, single-site basis size
    Output:
    initial_block: instance of the "Block" class, with attributes "length", "basis_size", "operator_dict"
                  - length: An integer representing the block's current length.
                  - basis_size: An integer indicating the size of the basis.
                  - operator_dict: A dictionary containing operators: Hamiltonian ("H":H1), 
                                   Connection operator ("conn_Sz":Sz1), and Connection operator("conn_Sp":Sp1).
                                   H1, Sz1 and Sp1: 2d array of float

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
