Construct the spatial differential operator a: Partial Derivative $\partial_i$. The first differential operator we want is a simple partial derivative: given an array of field values on 3d meshes, compute the partial derivates and return $\partial_x f(x,y,z)$, $\partial_y f(x,y,z)$ and $\partial_z f(x,y,z)$. We need a second order finite difference operator and on the boundary please use one-sided second-order expression.

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Construct the spatial differential operator e: Gradient of Divergence $\nabla_i (\nabla_j v^j)$. Please use the second order finite difference to calculate the gradient of the divergence of a vector fields. The fields are on a 3d mesh with the same grid length. Please note by first taking a divergence and then apply the gradient will result in larger error. Need to work out a finite difference formula for this operator.
Background

If we want to calculate the x gradient of divergence of vector field A then, we need to calculate 
$$
\partial_x (\partial_j A^j)  = \partial_x \partial_x A^x + \partial_x\partial_y A^{y} + \partial_x\partial_z A^z
$$
the first term is the second derivative of $A^x$, the last two terms are mixed second derivatives and can also be implemented in second order finite difference as 
$$
(\partial_x \partial_y A^y)_{ijk} = \frac{1}{4\Delta^2}(A^y_{i+1,j+1,k} - A^y_{i-1,j+1,k} - A^y_{i+1,j-1,k} + A^y_{i-1,j-1,k})
$$
with $\Delta$ denoting the grid length.
