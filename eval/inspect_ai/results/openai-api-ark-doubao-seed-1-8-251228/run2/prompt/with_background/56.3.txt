PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

From the definition, there are R factorial possible depletion orders. Due to the given preference lists, some of them are logically impossible (For example, if all the preference lists are [1, 2, 3, 4], resource 4 will not be the first to be depleted), so you need to filter them out. Write a function allowed_orders to do this task, where the input is pref_list, and the output is an list of n_allowed by R, where n_allowed is the number of allowed depletion orders.



def allowed_orders(pref):
    '''Check allowed depletion orders for a set of species with given preference orders
    Input:
    pref: species' preference order, 2d numpy array with dimensions [N, R] and int elements between 1 and R
    Output:
    allowed_orders_list: n_allowed by R, list of tuples with int elements betweem 1 and R. 
    '''
    N, R = pref.shape
    # Precompute position of each resource in each species' preference list
    pos = np.zeros((N, R + 1), dtype=int)  # pos[n][r] is index of resource r in species n's list
    for n in range(N):
        row = pref[n]
        for idx in range(R):
            r = row[idx]
            pos[n][r] = idx
    
    # Precompute constraints: list of (s, r) where s must come before r
    constraints = []
    for s in range(1, R + 1):
        for r in range(1, R + 1):
            if s == r:
                continue
            # Check if all species prefer s over r
            if np.all(pos[:, s] < pos[:, r]):
                constraints.append((s, r))
    
    allowed_orders_list = []
    # Generate all possible permutations of resources
    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(1, R + 1)):
        # Create position map for current permutation
        perm_pos = {res: idx for idx, res in enumerate(perm)}
        valid = True
        for s, r in constraints:
            if perm_pos[s] >= perm_pos[r]:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            allowed_orders_list.append(perm)
    
    return allowed_orders_list

Implement a function that converts growth rates based on resources (g) to growth rates based on temporal niches (G) to determine what resources would be present in each temporal niche and make an output of G, where G[i, j] is the i-th species' growth rate in the j-th temporal niche. The input consists of 3 arrays. First, the growth rate g, where float element g[i, j] is i-th species' growth rate on j-th resource. Then, the preference list pref, where pref[i, j] is the resource index of the i-th species' j-th most preferred resource (Resources are indexed from 1 to R). For example, if pref[3, 0] is 2, it means the top choice for species 3 is resource 2. And the third input is the resource depletion order dep_order, a tuple of length R. dep_order[i] is the i-th depleted resource. The output G is an array of N by R.



def G_mat(g, pref, dep_order):
    '''Convert to growth rates based on temporal niches
    Input
    g: growth rates based on resources, 2d numpy array with dimensions [N, R] and float elements
    pref: species' preference order, 2d numpy array with dimensions [N, R] and int elements between 1 and R
    dep_order: resource depletion order, a tuple of length R with int elements between 1 and R
    Output
    G: "converted" growth rates based on temporal niches, 2d numpy array with dimensions [N, R]
    '''
    N, R = g.shape
    # Precompute depletion step for each resource: dep_step[r] is index of r in dep_order
    dep_step = np.zeros(R + 1, dtype=int)  # 1-based resource indexing, index 0 unused
    for k in range(R):
        r = dep_order[k]
        dep_step[r] = k
    
    G = np.zeros_like(g)
    
    for i in range(N):
        pref_i = pref[i]  # Preference list of species i (most to least preferred)
        # Get depletion steps for resources in species i's preference order
        k_list = dep_step[pref_i]
        current_m = 0
        best_r = np.zeros(R, dtype=int)
        
        for j in range(R):
            # Find the first available resource in preference order for niche j
            while current_m < R and k_list[current_m] < j:
                current_m += 1
            best_r[j] = pref_i[current_m]
        
        # Map to growth rates using 0-based column indexing for g
        G[i] = g[i, best_r - 1]
    
    return G


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

For a given "converted" growth rate matrix G based on temporal niches and the dilution factor D, solve the system, find the lengths $t_i$ of the temporal niches, and determine if this is a feasible steady state of coexistence.
Background
For exponentially growing species $i$, its growth in one dilution cycle should satisfy that $\exp(\sum_j G_{\alpha j}t_j)=D$, or $\sum_j G_{\alpha j}t_j=\log D$. This is feasible only if the solution $t_i$'s exist, are unique, and all have positive values. Note that the value of D is actually unnecessary in this calculation.

def check_G_feasibility(G, D):
    '''Determine if a "converted" growth rate matrix G leads to a feasible coexistence. 
    Input 
    G: growth rate based on temporal niches, 2d numpy float array with dimensions [N, R]
    D: dilution factor, float
    Output
    feasible: boolean
    '''

    return feasible
