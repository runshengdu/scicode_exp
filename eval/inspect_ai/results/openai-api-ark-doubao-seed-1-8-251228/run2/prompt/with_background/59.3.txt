PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Implement a function that creates the rotation operator gates $R_x$, $R_y$, and $R_z$ with the given angle $\theta$.
Background
The rotation operator gates are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
R_x(\theta) & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\cos (\theta / 2) & -i \cdot \sin (\theta / 2) \\
-i \cdot \sin (\theta / 2) & \cos (\theta / 2)
\end{array}\right) \\
R_y(\theta) & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\cos (\theta / 2) & -\sin (\theta / 2) \\
\sin (\theta / 2) & \cos (\theta / 2)
\end{array}\right) \\
R_z(\theta) & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\exp (-i \theta / 2) & 0 \\
0 & \exp (i \theta / 2)
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Write a function to generate the trial wavefunction $
|\psi\rangle$ depending on one parameter $\theta$ with the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz, i.e., $
|\psi(\theta)\rangle=\exp \left(-i \theta Y_1 X_2\right)|01\rangle
$, in terms of a series of quantum gates acting on the initial two-qubit state $|00\rangle
$.
Background: The Hartree-Fock state $|01\rangle$ can be obtained from $|00\rangle = {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
1&0&0&0
\end{array}} \right)^T}$ by acting the rotation $R_x(\pi)$ on the second qubit. The unitary transformation $U(\theta)=\exp \left(-i \theta Y_1 X_2 \right)$ can be given by sequentially applying the following quantum logic gates:
$R_y(\pi/2)$ rotation gate on the first qubit and $R_x (-\pi/2)$ rotation gate on the second qubit.
2. CNOT12
3. $R_z(-2\theta)$ rotation gate on the second qubit.
4. CNOT12
5. $R_y(-\pi/2)$ rotation gate on the first qubit and $R_x (\pi/2)$ roation gate on the second qubit.

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

In the real experiment, The measurement of any Pauli operators $\hat{O}_i$ will be performed by applying an additional unitary transformation $U_i$ at the end of the circuit and measuring $Z_1$ of the first qubit (or say ${Z_1} \otimes I$ of the system). Given $U_i$ and the qubit state $
|\psi\rangle$, find the expectation value of the $Z_1$ measurement.
