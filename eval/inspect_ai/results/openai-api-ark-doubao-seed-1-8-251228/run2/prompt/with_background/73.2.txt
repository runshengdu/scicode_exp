PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write down the matrix, $\mathbf{B}$, that transforms $(h,k,l)$ coordinates from the reciprocal lattice system to $(q_x,q_y,q_z)$ coordinates in the right-handed Cartesian system.  Let's assume they share an identical origin, with $\mathbf{\hat{x}}^*//\mathbf{\hat{a}}^*$ and $\mathbf{\hat{z}}^*//(\mathbf{\hat{a}}^* \times \mathbf{\hat{b}}^*)$. The direct lattice parameters $(a,b,c,\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ are given in units of Å and degree. Additionally, we will follow the convention $\mathbf{a_i} \cdot \mathbf{b_j} = \delta_{ij}$, with {$\mathbf{a_i}$} and {$\mathbf{b_i}$} representing the primitive vectors of crystal lattice and reciprocal lattice respectively [<u>duplicate Xray_conversion-I step </u>]
Background
The reciprocal lattice vectors {$\mathbf{b}_i$} are given by:
$$\mathbf{b}_i = \frac{\mathbf{a}_j\times\mathbf{a}_k}{\mathbf{a}_i\cdot(\mathbf{a}_j\times\mathbf{a}_k)}$$


def Bmat(pa):
    '''Calculate the B matrix.
    Input
    pa = (a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma)
    a,b,c: the lengths a, b, and c of the three cell edges meeting at a vertex, float in the unit of angstrom
    alpha,beta,gamma: the angles alpha, beta, and gamma between those edges, float in the unit of degree
    Output
    B: a 3*3 matrix, float
    '''
    a, b, c, alpha_deg, beta_deg, gamma_deg = pa
    # Convert angles from degrees to radians
    alpha = np.radians(alpha_deg)
    beta = np.radians(beta_deg)
    gamma = np.radians(gamma_deg)
    
    # Construct direct lattice vectors in Cartesian coordinates
    a1 = np.array([a, 0.0, 0.0])
    a2_x = b * np.cos(gamma)
    a2_y = b * np.sin(gamma)
    a2 = np.array([a2_x, a2_y, 0.0])
    
    a3_x = c * np.cos(beta)
    numerator_a3y = np.cos(alpha) - np.cos(beta) * np.cos(gamma)
    denominator_a3y = np.sin(gamma)
    a3_y = c * numerator_a3y / denominator_a3y
    a3_z_sq = c**2 - a3_x**2 - a3_y**2
    a3_z = np.sqrt(a3_z_sq)
    a3 = np.array([a3_x, a3_y, a3_z])
    
    # Calculate unit cell volume
    V = np.dot(a1, np.cross(a2, a3))
    
    # Compute reciprocal lattice vectors
    b1 = np.cross(a2, a3) / V
    b2 = np.cross(a3, a1) / V
    b3 = np.cross(a1, a2) / V
    
    # Construct B matrix with reciprocal vectors as columns
    B = np.column_stack((b1, b2, b3))
    
    return B


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

The detector plane has roll, pitch, and yaw angles. In the lab coordinate system, yaw $\Psi$ represents rotation along the $+\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ axis, pitch $\Theta$ along the $+\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ axis, and roll $\Phi$ along the $+\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ axis, with the rotation sequence as yaw $\rightarrow$ pitch $\rightarrow$ roll. Write down the momentum transfer $\vec{Q} = \vec{k_s} - \vec{k_i}$ at detector pixel $(x_{det},y_{det})$ in the lab coordinate system, where $\vec{k_s}$ and $\vec{k_i}$ are scattered and incident beam respectively. In the lab coordinate, $+\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ aligns with the incident beam direction, while $+\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ points vertically upwards. In the detector coordinate, $\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{det}//-\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{y}}_{det}//-\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ if detector plane is normal to the incident beam
Background
The detector rotation matrix is defined as $\mathbf{D} = R_{\mathbf{\hat{x}}}(\Phi)R_{\mathbf{\hat{y}}}(\Theta)R_{\mathbf{\hat{z}}}(\Psi)$

def q_cal_p(p, b_c, det_d, p_s, wl, yaw, pitch, roll):
    '''Calculate the momentum transfer Q at detector pixel (x,y). Here we use the convention of k=1/\lambda,
    k and \lambda are the x-ray momentum and wavelength respectively
    Input
    p: detector pixel (x,y), a tuple of two integer
    b_c: incident beam center at detector pixel (xc,yc), a tuple of float
    det_d: sample distance to the detector, float in the unit of mm
    p_s: detector pixel size, and each pixel is a square, float in the unit of mm
    wl: X-ray wavelength, float in the unit of angstrom
    yaw,pitch,roll: rotation angles of the detector, float in the unit of degree
    Output
    Q: a 3x1 matrix, float in the unit of inverse angstrom
