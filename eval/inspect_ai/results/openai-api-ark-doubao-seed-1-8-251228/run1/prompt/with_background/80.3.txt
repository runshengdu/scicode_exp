PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Minimum Image Distance Function

Implementing Python function named `dist` that calculates the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
Background:
The function should implement the minimum image convention, which is used in molecular dynamics simulations to consider the shortest distance between periodic images of particles.


def dist(r1, r2, L):
    '''Calculate the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
    Parameters:
    r1 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the first atom.
    r2 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the second atom.
    L (float): The length of the side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    float: The minimum image distance between the two atoms.
    '''
    # Calculate the coordinate differences
    dr = np.array(r1) - np.array(r2)
    # Apply minimum image convention to each component
    dr = dr - L * np.round(dr / L)
    # Compute Euclidean distance of the adjusted difference vector
    distance = np.linalg.norm(dr)
    return distance

Lennard-Jones Potential

Implementing a Python function named `E_ij` to get Lennard-Jones potential with potential well depth epislon that reaches zero at distance sigma between pair of atoms with distance r. which is truncated and shifted to zero at a cutoff distance `rc`.
Background
The Lennard-Jones potential models soft repulsive and attractive (van der Waals) interactions. Hence, the Lennard-Jones potential describes electronically neutral atoms or molecules. The commonly used expression for the Lennard-Jones potential is:

$V^{tr-sh}_{LJ}(r) =
\begin{cases}
V_{LJ}(r)-V_{LJ}(r_c), & \text{if } r < r_c\\
0, & \text{if } r > r_c
\end{cases}
$

$
V_{LJ}(r) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{6} \right].
$

$
V_{LJ}(r_c) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^{6} \right].
$

where r is the distance between two interacting particles, epsilon is the depth of the potential well (usually referred to as 'dispersion energy'), and sigma is the distance at which the particle-particle potential energy V is zero (often referred to as 'size of the particle').

The potential is truncated and shifted at a distance $ r_c $ to ensure the interaction energy becomes zero for $ r > r_c $, simplifying the force computations.


def E_ij(r, sigma, epsilon, rc):
    '''Calculate the combined truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones potential energy and,
    if specified, the truncated and shifted Yukawa potential energy between two particles.
    Parameters:
    r (float): The distance between particles i and j.
    sigma (float): The distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    epsilon (float): The depth of the potential well for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    rc (float): The cutoff distance beyond which the potentials are truncated and shifted to zero.
    Returns:
    float: The combined potential energy between the two particles, considering the specified potentials.
    '''
    if r >= rc:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate Lennard-Jones potential at distance r
    sigma_over_r = sigma / r
    lj_r = 4 * epsilon * (sigma_over_r ** 12 - sigma_over_r ** 6)
    
    # Calculate Lennard-Jones potential at cutoff distance rc
    sigma_over_rc = sigma / rc
    lj_rc = 4 * epsilon * (sigma_over_rc ** 12 - sigma_over_rc ** 6)
    
    # Return truncated and shifted potential
    return lj_r - lj_rc


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Energy of the whole system

Write a function to get the total energy of the whole system, given the function "E_ij", which computes the Lennard-Jones Potential between pair of atoms. The total energy is calculated as the sum of local energies.
Background
The local energy refers to the energy between the two atoms next to each other.

def E_pot(xyz, L, sigma, epsilon, rc):
    '''Calculate the total potential energy of a system using the truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones potential.
    Parameters:
    xyz : A NumPy array with shape (N, 3) where N is the number of particles. Each row contains the x, y, z coordinates of a particle in the system.
    L (float): Lenght of cubic box
    r (float): The distance between particles i and j.
    sigma (float): The distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    epsilon (float): The depth of the potential well for the Lennard-Jones potential.
    rc (float): The cutoff distance beyond which the potentials are truncated and shifted to zero.
