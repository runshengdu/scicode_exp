PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

First consider the Schrodinger equation of the form: $(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2-\frac{Z e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r})\psi(\vec{r})=E \psi(\vec{r})$. Write a function to calculate $f(r)$ if we rewrite this Shroedinger equation in the form $u''(r) = f(r)u(r)$. The radii $r\_grid$, energy $energy$ and angular momentum quantum number $l$ will be given as input. Use $Z=1$ in this step.
Background
The Schroedinger equation without the Hartree term is:

\begin{eqnarray}
(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2-\frac{Z e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r})\psi(\vec{r})=E \psi(\vec{r})
\end{eqnarray}

using ansatz:

$\psi(\vec{r}) = Y_{lm}(\hat{r})\; u(r)/r$

and introducing dimensionless variables:

\begin{eqnarray}
x = \frac{r}{r_B}\\
\varepsilon = \frac{E}{E_0}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
&& r_B = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m e^2} \approx 0.529 A\\
&& E_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m r_B^2} == Ry \approx 13.6 eV
\end{eqnarray}

we get the differential equation

\begin{eqnarray}
u''(x)-
\left(\frac{l(l+1)}{x^2}-\frac{2Z}{x}-\varepsilon\right)u(x)=0
\end{eqnarray}

Write a function to solve for $u(r)$ in the differential equation of the form $u''(r) = f(r)u(r)$ with the Numerov method. $f(r)$, $u(0)$, $u'(0)$ and the step size will be given as input. Ignore the Hartree term in this step.
Background

We can use the Numerov algorithm to solve the second-order linear differential equation of the form:

$$
x''(t) = f(t)x(t) + u(t)\tag{1}
$$

Expanding $x(t)$ in a Taylor series and considering the time-reversal symmetry of the equation leads to the cancellation of all odd-order terms:

$$
\begin{align}
x(h) &= x(0) + h x'(0) + \frac{1}{2}h^2 x''(0) + \frac{1}{3!}h^3 x^{(3)}(0) + \frac{1}{4!}h^4 x^{(4)}(0) + \frac{1}{5!}h^5 x^{(5)}(0) + \dots \tag{2}\\
x(-h) &= x(0) - h x'(0) + \frac{1}{2}h^2 x''(0) - \frac{1}{3!}h^3 x^{(3)}(0) + \frac{1}{4!}h^4 x^{(4)}(0) - \frac{1}{5!}h^5 x^{(5)}(0) + \dots \tag{3}
\end{align}
$$

Summing the above two equations results in:

$$
x(h) + x(-h) = 2x(0) + h^2 (f(0)x(0) + u(0)) + \frac{2}{4!}h^4 x^{(4)}(0) + O(h^6) \tag{4}
$$

For an algorithm of order $O(h^4)$, ignoring the $x^{(4)}$ term simplifies the recursion relation to:

$$
x_{i+1} = 2 x_i - x_{i-1} + h^2 (f_i x_i + u_i) + O(h^4) \tag{5}
$$

where
$$
\begin{align}
x_{i-1} &= x(-h) \\
x_i &= x(0) \\
x_{i+1} &= x(h)
\end{align}
$$

From equation (1) we know that its fourth derivative is:

$$
x^{(4)} = \frac{d^2}{dt^2}(f(t)x(t) + u(t)) \tag{6}
$$

Using the discrete approximation for the second derivative:

$$
g''(t) = \frac{g(t+h) - 2g(t) + g(t-h)}{h^2} + O(h^2) \tag{7}
$$

we can approximate $x^{(4)}$ by:

$$
x^{(4)} = \frac{f_{i+1}x_{i+1} + u_{i+1} - 2f_i x_i - 2u_i + f_{i-1}x_{i-1} + u_{i-1}}{h^2} + O(h^2) \tag{8}
$$

Inserting this fourth derivative into equation (5) gives:

$$
x_{i+1} - 2 x_i + x_{i-1} = h^2(f_i x_i + u_i) + \frac{h^2}{12}(f_{i+1}x_{i+1} + u_{i+1} - 2f_i x_i - 2u_i + f_{i-1}x_{i-1} + u_{i-1}) + O(h^6) \tag{9}
$$

If we apply the following change of variables:

$$
w_i = x_i\left(1 - \frac{h^2}{12} f_i\right) - \frac{h^2}{12}u_i
$$

the recursion equation becomes:

$$
w_{i+1} = 2 w_i - w_{i-1} + h^2 (f_i x_i + u_i) + O(h^6) \tag{10}
$$
where $x_i$ is recalculated at each step using:

$$
x_i = \frac{w_i + \frac{h^2}{12}u_i}{1 - \frac{h^2}{12}f_i}
$$

Write a function to solve the Schroedinger equation using the two functions defined above (f_Schrod and Numerov). Normalize the result using Simpson's rule. The u_at_0 is 0, up_at_0 is -1e-7. Do the integration from the largest radius. The numerov step size should be r_grid[0]-r_grid[1].



print('Hello, World!')


------

As part of the shooting algorithm to be used later, write a function that linearly extrapolates the value of the wavefunction at $r=0$ using the wavefunctions at the first and second grid points in the radial grid calculated from the compute_Schrod function. Before the extrapolation, divide the wavefunction by $r^{l}$, where r is the corresponding radius of a wavefunction value and $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number.
Background
**Shooting algorithm:**

The boundary condistions are given at two points $a$ and $b$, i.e., $u(a)=u(b)=0$. 

* **Choose $u(a)=0$ and $u'(a)=c$, with $c$ some constant.**
* **Solve for $u(x)$ to the other end, and evaluate $u(b)$.**


print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a function to search for bound states with a given angular momentum quantum number $l$ using the shoot function defined previously and a root-finding routine such as the brentq routine in scipy. Ignore the Hartree term in this step. The maximum number of bound states to be searched for should be set to 10.
Background

**Shooting algorithm:** 

The boundary condistions are given at two points $a$ and $b$, i.e., $u(a)=u(b)=0$. 

* Choose $u(a)=0$ and $u'(a)=c$, with $c$ some constant.
* Solve for $u(x)$ to the other end, and evaluate $u(b)$.

* **Using root finding routine find energy $\varepsilon$ for which u(b)=0. This is the bound state.**
* **Continue with increasing energy $\varepsilon$ until sufficient number of bound states is found**


print('Hello, World!')


------

Given a list of all bound states found (up to a specified angular momentum quantum number $l$), sort the list by energy and angular momentum quantum number. State with lower energy will be in front. If two states have the same energy, the one with smaller angular momentum quantum number will be in front. Ensure that angular momentum quantum number only affects (by a factor of 1/10000.0) the order when energy values are very close or identical.

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function to calculate the radius-dependent charge density of the bound states. The bound states will be calculated from the find_bound_states function in prompt and be given as input. This function should sort the bound states input using the sort_states function in prompt . Then it should populate the available orbitals with the sorted states, taking into consideration the total number of available states and their degeneracy based on their angular momentum quantum numbers. Next, it should calculate the charge density of the states based on their wavefunctions calculated from the compute_Schrod function in prompt . Store the density and return it.
Background
When populating the orbitals, it is convenient to define a variable $fermi\_factor$. If there is enough states left to fill an orbital completely, $fermi\_factor = 1$. Otherwise, $fermi\_factor = (Z-N)/D$, where Z is the atomic number, N is the number of states already assigned to an orbital, and D is the degneracy of the orbital currently being filled. Multiply this variable with the computed charge density to get the correct contribution.

def calculate_charge_density(bound_states, r_grid, Z):
    '''Input
    bound_states: bound states found using the find_bound_states function; a list of tuples
    r_grid: the radial grid; a 1D array of float
    Z: atomic number; int
    Output
    charge_density: the calculated charge density coming from the bound states; 1D array of float
    '''

    return charge_density
