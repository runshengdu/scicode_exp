PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Create a function to compute the incomplete Cholesky factorization of an input matrix.
Background:
An incomplete Cholesky factorization provides a sparse approximation of the Cholesky factorization for a symmetric positive definite matrix. This factorization is commonly employed as a preconditioner for iterative algorithms such as the conjugate gradient method.

In the Cholesky factorization of a positive definite matrix $A$, we have $A = LL*$, where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix. The incomplete Cholesky factorization yields a sparse lower triangular matrix $K$ that closely approximates $L$. The corresponding preconditioner is $KK*$.

A popular approach to find the matrix $K$ is to adapt the algorithm for the exact Cholesky decomposition, ensuring that $K$ retains the same sparsity pattern as $A$ (any zero entry in $A$ leads to a zero entry in $K$). This method produces an incomplete Cholesky factorization that is as sparse as matrix $A$.

For $i$ from $1$ to $N$ :
$$
L_{i i}=\left(a_{i i}-\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} L_{i k}^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

For $j$ from $i+1$ to $N$ :
$$
L_{j i}=\frac{1}{L_{i i}}\left(a_{j i}-\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} L_{i k} L_{j k}\right)
$$
