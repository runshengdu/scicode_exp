PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Using a polytropic equation of state, write a function that computes pressure given density. The function shall take as input the density `rho` as a float as well as euqation of state parameters `eos_kappa` and `eos_Gamma`. The output is the pressure `press` as a float.
Background
An equation of state establishes a relationship between density and pressure. A simple model of a fluid a zero temperature is given by the polytropic equation of state:

$$
P(\rho) = \kappa \rho^\Gamma
$$


def eos_press_from_rho(rho, eos_Gamma, eos_kappa):
    '''This function computes pressure for a polytropic equation of state given the density.
    Inputs:
    rho: the density, a float.
    eos_Gamma: adiabatic exponent of the equation of state, a float
    eos_kappa: coefficient of the equation of state, a float
    Outputs:
    press: pressure corresponding to the given density, a float
    '''
    press = eos_kappa * (rho ** eos_Gamma)
    return press

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Using a polytropic equation of state combined with the Gamma-law equation of state, write a function that computes specific internal energy given density. The function shall take as input the density `rho` as a float as well as euqation of state parameters `eos_kappa` and `eos_Gamma`. The output is the specific internal energy `eps` as a float.
Background
An equation of state establishes a relationship between density and pressure. A simple model of a fluid a zero temperature is given by the polytropic equation of state:

$$
P(\rho) = \kappa \rho^\Gamma
$$

An ideal gas or other ideal fluid obeyes the Gamma-law equation of state

$$
P(\rho, \epsilon) = \rho \epsilon (\Gamma-1)
$$

where $\epsilon$ is the specific internal energy.

def eos_eps_from_press(press, eos_Gamma, eos_kappa):
    '''This function computes specific internal energy for a polytropic equation of state given the pressure.
    Inputs:
    press: the pressure, a float.

    eos_kappa: coefficient of the equation of state, a float

    eps: the specific internal energy, a float.

    return eps
