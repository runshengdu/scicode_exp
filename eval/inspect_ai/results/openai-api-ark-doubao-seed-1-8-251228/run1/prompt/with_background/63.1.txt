Write a function that sets up a price-time grid to perform finite-difference method to solve for Black-Scholes Equation given number of price grid, number of time grid, min and max price of stock, low and max bounds for the price grid, and strike price. Give me price grid, time grid, and corresponding step size
Background

Black-Scholes Equation
Through hedging with the underlying stock and bond, one can effectively mitigate the impact of the Brownian motion component of the equation, which serves as the primary source of uncertainty of original applications of Ito's lemma without hedging. After some steps, we arrive to

$$
\frac{\partial V(s,t)}{\partial t} + rs\frac{\partial V(s,t)}{\partial s} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 s^2 \frac{\partial^2 V(s,t)}{\partial s^2} -rV(t,s) = 0
$$
Here,<br>
V: Option price <br>
s: Underlying stock price <br>
t: time <br>
r: risk-free interest rate (interest when you buy bonds) <br>
$\sigma$: volatility of underlying stock<br>

Assumptions
- European Options (you can only excercise the right of your option at the termination date)
- No arbitrage (can't take risk-free benefit more than $r$)
- Frictionless market (low transaction cost)
- Stock prices follow log normal distribution (to avoid negative values)

Using these assumptions, it is convenient and logical to define a log stock price variable $p=\log s$ so that the equation become<br>

$$
\frac{\partial V(p,t)}{\partial t}+\big(r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\big)\frac{\partial V(p,t)}{\partial p}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 V(p,t)}{\partial p^2}-r V(p,t) = 0
$$

We will work with the this version of Black Scholes

Theoretically, option price can be ranging from 0 to $\infty$, but we need to restrict it to plausible range to compute on a finite grid. Finite difference would be like:
For the log-adjusted Black Scholes equation, we can use forward euler time stepping, central difference for the price derivative terms. Then it becomes
$$
\frac{V^{n+1}_j-V^n_j}{\Delta t}+\big(r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\big)\frac{V^{n}_{j+1}-V^n_{j-1}}{2\Delta p}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \frac{V^{n}_{j+1}+V^n_{j-1}-2V^n_j}{\Delta p^2}-rV^n_j = 0
$$

def initialize_grid(price_step, time_step, strike, max_price, min_price):
    '''Initializes the grid for pricing a European call option.
    Inputs:
    price_step: The number of steps or intervals in the price direction. (int)
    time_step: The number of steps or intervals in the time direction. (int)
    strike: The strike price of the European call option. (float)
    max_price: we can't compute infinity as bound, so set a max bound. 5 * strike price is generous (float)
    min_price: avoiding 0 as a bound due to numerical instability, (1/5) * strike price is generous (float)
    Outputs:
    p: An array containing the grid points for prices. It is calculated using np.linspace function between p_min and p_max.  shape: price_step * 1
    dp: The spacing between adjacent price grid points. (float)
    T: An array containing the grid points for time. It is calculated using np.linspace function between 0 and 1. shape: time_step * 1
    dt: The spacing between adjacent time grid points. (float)
    '''

    return p, dp, T, dt
