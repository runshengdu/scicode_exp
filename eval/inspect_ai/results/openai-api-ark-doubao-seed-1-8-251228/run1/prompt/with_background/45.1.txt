PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function to initialize a 3D and a 2D array for a 2D heat equation problem. With input sizes, the 3D array will store temperatures, where the first dimension is time, and the second and third dimensions are x and y coordinates of the grid. The grid is divided into two parts by a vertical interface at a specified index. Grid points on the interface and to the left represent material one, with an initial temperature `T1` and thermal diffusivity `alpha1`. The remaining grid points represent material two with an initial temperature `T2` and thermal diffusivity `alpha2`. The 2D array stores the thermal diffusivities. Populate only the first time step with the initial temperatures, and initialize arrays for later time steps to zero.


def init_grid(Nt, Nx, Ny, x_split, T1, alpha1, T2, alpha2):
    '''Initialize a 3d array for storing the temperature values. The array has one time dimension and two real space dimensions.
    Initialize a 2d array for storing the thermal diffusivity corresponding to each grid point in real space.  
    There could be a vertical boundary in real space that represents the interface between two different materials.
    Input
    Nt: time dimension of the temperature grid; int
    Nx: x-dimension (number of columns) of the temperature grid; int
    Ny: y-dimension (number of rows) of the temperature grid; int
    x_split: the column index of the vertical interface. All columns up to and including this index (material 1) will have T1 and alpha1, and all columns with a larger index (material 2) will have T2 and alpha2; int
    T1: the initial temperature of each grid point for material 1(in Celsius); float
    alpha1: the thermal diffusivity of material 1; float
    T1: the initial temperature of each grid point for material 2(in Celsius); float
    alpha2: the heat conductivity of material 2; float
    Output
    temp_grid: temperature grid; 3d array of floats
    diff_grid: thermal diffusivity grid; 2d array of floats
    '''

    return temp_grid, diff_grid

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
