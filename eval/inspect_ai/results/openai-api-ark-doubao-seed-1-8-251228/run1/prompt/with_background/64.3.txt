PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Wrap to periodic boundaries
Implementing a Python function named `wrap`. This function should apply periodic boundary conditions to the coordinates of a particle inside a cubic simulation box.
Background:
To implement PBC, the unit cell is surrounded by translated copies in all directions to approximate an infinitely large system. When one molecule diffuses across the boundary of the simulation box it reappears on the opposite side. So each molecule always interacts with its neighbours even though they may be on opposite sides of the simulation box


def wrap(r, L):
    '''Apply periodic boundary conditions to a vector of coordinates r for a cubic box of size L.
    Parameters:
    r : The (x, y, z) coordinates of a particle.
    L (float): The length of each side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    coord: numpy 1d array of floats, the wrapped coordinates such that they lie within the cubic box.
    '''
    coord = np.mod(r, L)
    return coord

Minimum Image Distance Function

Implementing Python function named `dist` that calculates the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
Background:
The function should implement the minimum image convention, which is used in molecular simulations to consider the shortest distance between periodic images of particles.


def dist(r1, r2, L):
    '''Calculate the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
    Parameters:
    r1 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the first atom.
    r2 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the second atom.
    L (float): The length of the side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    float: The minimum image distance between the two atoms.
    '''
    r1_np = np.array(r1)
    r2_np = np.array(r2)
    dr = r1_np - r2_np
    # Apply minimum image convention to the difference vector
    dr = np.mod(dr + L / 2, L) - L / 2
    # Calculate Euclidean distance of the adjusted difference vector
    distance = np.linalg.norm(dr)
    return distance


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Lennard-Jones Potential Function

Implementing a Python function named `E_ij` to  get Lennard-Jones potential with potential well depth epislon that reaches zero at distance sigma between pair of atoms with distance r.
Background

The Lennard-Jones potential models soft repulsive and attractive (van der Waals) interactions. Hence, the Lennard-Jones potential describes electronically neutral atoms or molecules. The commonly used expression for the Lennard-Jones potential is:

$V_{\mathrm{LJ}}(r)=4 \varepsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]$

where r is the distance between two interacting particles, epsilon is the depth of the potential well (usually referred to as 'dispersion energy'), and sigma is the distance at which the particle-particle potential energy V is zero (often referred to as 'size of the particle').

def E_ij(r, sigma, epsilon):
    '''Calculate the Lennard-Jones potential energy between two particles.
    Parameters:
    r : float
        The distance between the two particles.
    sigma : float
        The distance at which the potential minimum occurs
    epsilon : float
        The depth of the potential well
    Returns:
    float
        The potential energy between the two particles at distance r.
    '''

    return E_lj
