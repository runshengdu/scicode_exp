PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

The Lotka-Volterra equation for a simple predator-prey system is given by : $$\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta xy$$ $$\frac{dy}{dt} = \beta xy - \gamma y$$ where $x$ is the population of preys and $y$ is the population of predators. Given current porpolations and parameters in Lotka-Volterra equation, perform a single-time update of the Lotka-Volterra equations using the Gillespie algorithm. To sample the time step, use NumPy's exponential distribution directly.
Background
Gillespie Algorithm is a computational method used to simulate the dynamics of stochastic systems as chemical reactions. At one step, each reaction $i$ is associated with a prospensity $a_i$, calculated as the product of the reaction rate and the populations of the species involved. The time until the next reaction occurs is sampled from an exponential distribution with a rate equal to the sum of all propensities, given by the probability density function: $$f(\Delta t) = \frac{1}{a} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta t}{a}\right)$$ where $a = \sum a_i$. At each time step, only one reaction occurs, and the reaction $i$ will be selected with the probability $P_i = \frac{a_i}{\sum a_i}$.


print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Given initial conditions and parameters, simulate the Lotka-Volterra equation up to a specified final time T. The simulation ends immediately if no event occurs at a given step. Record both the time coordinates and the evolution of populations. Identify which of the following ecological events occurred during their evolution: "coexistence", "predator extinction", or "mutual extinction".
Background
"Coexistence" indicates that both predator and prey survive; "predator extinction" means only predator polpulation goes to zero, and usually the prey population will blow up; "mutual extinction" happens when prey die out first and the predator will die out eventually due to lack of food.

def evolve_LV(prey, predator, alpha, beta, gamma, T):
    '''Simulate the predator-prey dynamics using the Gillespie simulation algorithm.
    This function tracks and records the populations of prey and predators and the times at which changes occur.
    Input:
    prey: initial population of prey, integer
    predator: initial population of predators, integer
    alpha: prey birth rate, float
    beta: predation rate, float
    gamma: predator death rate, float
    T: total time of the simulation, float
    Output:
    time_cor: time coordinates of population evolution, 1D array of floats
    prey_evol: evolution history of prey population, 1D array of floats (same size as time_cor)
    predator_evol: evolution history of predator population, 1D array of floats (same size as time_cor)
    eco_event: A string describing the ecological event ("coexistence", "predator extinction", or "mutual extinction").
    '''

    return time_cor, prey_evol, predator_evol, eco_event

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
