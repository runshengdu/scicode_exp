PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

The motion of a forced, damped single pendulum can be described by the second-order differential equation. Assuming the damping force is proportional to the angular velocity with coefficient $\beta$ and the external driving force *$A \cos(\alpha t)$* oscillates with time ($A$: drive amplitude, $\alpha$:drive frequency). Define the differential equations in python for this forced, damped Pendulum. The solution of this differential equation, $ y=[\theta, \omega]^T$, represents the state vector of the system, which includes the angle *$\theta$* and the angular velocity *$\omega$*. $\theta$ is measured in radians and $\omega$ in radians per second.
Background

A single pendulum consists of:
- A mass $m$ attached to the end of a string or rod of length $L$.
- The pivot point is frictionless.
- There is a damping force proportional to the angular velocity with a damping coefficient $\beta$.
- An external driving force $A \cos(\alpha t)$ oscillates with time.

(a) Identify the Forces and Torques

The forces acting on the pendulum bob are:
- Gravitational force $mg$ acting downward.
- Tension in the string (which does not do work as it acts along the string).
- Damping force proportional to the angular velocity $-\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt}$.
- External driving force $A \cos(\alpha t)$.

The torque $\tau$ around the pivot due to the gravitational force, damping force, and driving force is given by:

$$
\tau = -mgL \sin(\theta) - \beta L \frac{d\theta}{dt} + A \cos(\alpha t)
$$

The moment of inertia $I$ for a point mass $m$ at a distance $L$ from the pivot is:

$$
I = mL^2
$$

(b) Apply Newton's Second Law for Rotation

Using Newton's second law for rotation $\tau = I \alpha$:

$$
-mgL \sin(\theta) - \beta L \frac{d\theta}{dt} + A \cos(\alpha t) = mL^2 \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}
$$

(c) Simplify the Equation

Dividing both sides by $mL^2$:

$$
-\frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) - \frac{\beta}{mL} \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{A}{mL^2} \cos(\alpha t) = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}
$$

Rearranging the terms:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{\beta}{mL} \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) = \frac{A}{mL^2} \cos(\alpha t)
$$

(d) Converting to First-Order ODEs

To use numerical methods like RK4, we need to convert this second-order ODE into a system of first-order ODEs by defining:

$$
\frac{d\theta}{dt}= \omega
$$


Then, the first-order ODEs for this damped, forced single pendulum system becomes:

$$
\frac{d\omega}{dt} = -\frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) - \frac{\beta}{mL} \omega+ \frac{A}{mL^2} \cos(\alpha t)
$$

(e) Define The State Vector

The state vector of this forced, damped pendulum is:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} \theta \\ \omega \end{pmatrix}
$$

------

Write a fourth-order fixed-time-step Runge-Kutta (RK4) integrator from scratch in Python, to calculate $\theta$ and $\omega$ at any certain timepoint. The output of this procedure — a series of state vectors representing the n-point state-space trajectory emanating from ~x(t0). Do not use any canned numerical integration routines, commands, functions.
Background

Given an initial value problem of the form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0
$$

the RK4 method updates the solution $y$ from time $t$ to $t + \Delta t$ using the following steps:

**2.1 Calculate intermediate slopes:**
   - $k_1 = f(t, y)$
   - $k_2 = f(t + \frac{\Delta t}{2}, y + \frac{k_1 \Delta t}{2})$
   - $k_3 = f(t + \frac{\Delta t}{2}, y + \frac{k_2 \Delta t}{2})$
   - $k_4 = f(t + \Delta t, y + k_3 \Delta t)$

**2.2 Update the solution:**

   $$
   y(t + \Delta t) = y(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{6} (k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
   $$

In our case, *$y$* represents the state vector of the system, which includes the angle *$\theta$* and the angular velocity *$\omega$*.

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Now write a function to analyze any damped, driven pendulum system to understand its dynamic behavior under various conditions. Your function should:

Sweep different timesteps to find the optimized timestep that balances accuracy and time efficiency.
2. Output the trajectory

The combined metric for finding the optimized time should penalize higher computational times while rewarding lower errors.

To better reflect this, we can use a combined metric such as:

$$
\text{Metric} = \text{GTE} \times \sqrt{\text{Time}}
$$

Global Truncation Error (GTE) is estimated using the step-doubling method. This way, longer computation times will have a more significant penalty, while still prioritizing low errors.
Background

The Step-Doubling Method

The step-doubling method is a practical and effective way to estimate the truncation error in numerical methods like the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4). This method provides an estimate of the error without needing the exact solution, which is often unavailable. Below, I'll explain how to use step-doubling to estimate the global truncation error (GTE) for RK4.

**Perform the Integration with Step Size $h$ and $2h$:**
   - **Single Step $2h$:** Compute the solution $y(t + 2h)$ from $y(t)$ using a single RK4 step with step size $2h$.
   - **Two Steps $h$:** Compute the solution $y(t + 2h)$ from $y(t)$ by taking two consecutive RK4 steps with step size $h$.

2. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - Let $y_{2h}$ denote the result of the single step with step size $2h$.
   - Let $y_{h,h}$ denote the result of the two steps with step size $h$.
   - Compute the difference $\Delta y = y_{h,h} - y_{2h}$.

3. **Estimate the Error:**
   - The error in the single $2h$ step can be approximated using the difference $\Delta y$ scaled by a factor dependent on the order of the method $n$, which is 4 for RK4. The scaling factor is $2^n - 1$, so for RK4, it is $2^4 - 1 = 15$.
   - The estimated error after a single step of $2h$ is:
     $$
     E_{2h} \approx \frac{\Delta y}{15}
     $$

4. **Global Truncation Error (GTE) Estimation:**
   - To estimate the global truncation error over an interval $[a, b]$, perform the step-doubling procedure at several points along the interval, or use it adaptively based on how $E_{2h}$ changes with each segment.
   - Sum these errors to get an estimate of the GTE for the whole interval.
