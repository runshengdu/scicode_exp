PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function to compute the initial condition as a cell-averaged approximation. This function should take the number of vertices $n$ as input. The output will be cell-averaged values, an array of length n-The numerical integral should be performed with three-point Gauss quadrature rule.
For an initial condition given by:
\begin{equation}
u_0 = \Bigg{\{}
\begin{aligned}
&\sin(x)-1 \quad -\pi/2< x \leq 0 \\
&\sin(x)+1 \quad \quad 0 < x < \pi/2\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Background:
The cell averaged value is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\bar{u} = \frac{1}{h}\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} u 
\end{equation}
Now approximate the initial value with the cell-averaged value.

def make_IC(n):
    '''The function computes the inital condition mentioned above
    Inputs:
    n  : number of grid points, integer
    Outputs:
    v  : cell averaged approximation of initial condition, 1d array size n-1
    '''

    return v

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

import numpy as np

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
