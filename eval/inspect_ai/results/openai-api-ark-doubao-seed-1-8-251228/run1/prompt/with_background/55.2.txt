PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Assumming periodic boundary conditrion, write a python function to simulate the Swift-Hohenberg in 2D space of N by N, using the pseudo-spectral method. The equation is given by $$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \epsilon u - (1 + q_0^{-2}\nabla^2)^2 u - u^3
$$ where $\epsilon$ serves as a control parameter of the system and $q_0$ is a critical mode. Given initial state $u_0$ at $t=0$, with a time step $dt$, solve the final state $u$ at time $T$. The order parameter $u$ remains real.
Background
Notice that the Swift-Hohenberg equation contains both gradient term and nonlinear term; hence, we adopt a split-step algorithm known as pseudo-spectral method. We rewrite the equation as
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = [\epsilon u - u - u^3]-[2q_0^{-2}\nabla^2 + q_0^{-4}\nabla^4]u
$$
For one time step update, the input is the current state $u_N$, and the output is the order parameter at the subsequent step $u_{N+1}$:
First, we update the term $\epsilon u - u - u^3$ in the position space to obtain an intermediate state $u_1$;
2. Next, we tranform the tranport term $-[2q_0^{-2}\nabla^2 + q_0^{-4}\nabla^4]u$ to k-space, and update it in k-space based on $u_1$ using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and then invert it back to real space using the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to obtain $u_{N+1}$.


print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Calculate the structure factor $Sk$ of a given order parameter field $u(x,y)$ and corresponding coordinates in k-space. Both $k_x$ and $k_y$ axes are symmetric around zero mode.
Background
At time $t$, Structure factor of the order parameter $u({\bf x}, t)$ defined as
$$
S({\bf k}, t) = | U({\bf k}, t)|^2
$$
where $U({\bf k}, t)$ denotes the spatial Fourier transform of $u({\bf x}, t)$ at the mode ${\bf k}$.

def structure_factor(u):
    '''Calculate the structure factor of a 2D real spatial distribution and the Fourier coordinates, shifted to center around k = 0
    Input
