PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Implement a function that creates the rotation operator gates $R_x$, $R_y$, and $R_z$ with the given angle $\theta$.
Background
The rotation operator gates are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
R_x(\theta) & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\cos (\theta / 2) & -i \cdot \sin (\theta / 2) \\
-i \cdot \sin (\theta / 2) & \cos (\theta / 2)
\end{array}\right) \\
R_y(\theta) & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\cos (\theta / 2) & -\sin (\theta / 2) \\
\sin (\theta / 2) & \cos (\theta / 2)
\end{array}\right) \\
R_z(\theta) & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\exp (-i \theta / 2) & 0 \\
0 & \exp (i \theta / 2)
\end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$


def rotation_matrices(axis, theta):
    '''Create rotation matrices Rx, Ry, and Rz with the given angle theta.
    Inputs:
    axis : int
        The rotation axis. 1 = x, 2 = y, 3 = z.
    theta : float
        The rotation angle.
    Output:
    R : matrix of shape(2, 2)
        The rotation matrix.

    theta_half = theta / 2
    if axis == 1:
        cos_h = np.cos(theta_half)
        sin_h = np.sin(theta_half)
        R = np.array([[cos_h, -1j * sin_h],
                      [-1j * sin_h, cos_h]])

        R = np.array([[cos_h, -sin_h],
                      [sin_h, cos_h]])

        raise ValueError("Axis must be 1 (x), 2 (y), or 3 (z)")
    return R


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function to generate the trial wavefunction $
|\psi\rangle$ depending on one parameter $\theta$ with the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz, i.e., $
|\psi(\theta)\rangle=\exp \left(-i \theta Y_1 X_2\right)|01\rangle
$, in terms of a series of quantum gates acting on the initial two-qubit state $|00\rangle
$.
Background: The Hartree-Fock state $|01\rangle$ can be obtained from $|00\rangle = {\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
1&0&0&0
\end{array}} \right)^T}$ by acting the rotation $R_x(\pi)$ on the second qubit. The unitary transformation $U(\theta)=\exp \left(-i \theta Y_1 X_2 \right)$ can be given by sequentially applying the following quantum logic gates:
$R_y(\pi/2)$ rotation gate on the first qubit and $R_x (-\pi/2)$ rotation gate on the second qubit.
2. CNOT12
3. $R_z(-2\theta)$ rotation gate on the second qubit.
4. CNOT12
5. $R_y(-\pi/2)$ rotation gate on the first qubit and $R_x (\pi/2)$ roation gate on the second qubit.

def create_ansatz(theta):
    '''Create the ansatz wavefunction with a given theta.
    Input:
    theta : float
        The only variational parameter.
    Output:
    ansatz : array of shape (4, 1)
        The ansatz wavefunction.
    '''

    return ansatz

DEPENDENCIES:

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
