PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Consider a semi-infinite system of layered electron gas (LEG) with a dielectric constant $\epsilon$ interfacing with vacuum at $z=0$. Each electron layer is positioned at $z=ld$, where $d$ is the layer spacing and $l \geq 0$. Determine the Coulomb interaction between two electrons at positions $(\mathbf{x},z)$ and $(\mathbf{x}^{\prime},z^{\prime})$ within the LEG, where $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}^{\prime}$ are 2D vectors parallel to the layers. Fourier transform this interaction with respect to $\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{\prime}$, and express the resulting form factor $f(q;z,z^{\prime})$, where $V(q;z,z^{\prime}) = V_qf(q;z,z^{\prime})$ and $V_q$ represents the Coulomb interaction in 2D [<u>duplicate LEG_Dyson equation-bulk step </u>]
Background
The image charge $q^{\prime}$ induced by the vacuum interface is given by:
$$q^{\prime} = \dfrac{\epsilon-\epsilon_0}{\epsilon+\epsilon_0}q$$
where $\epsilon$ represents the dielectric constant of the material and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of vacuum

In a LEG, electrons in distinct layers only interact through Coulomb interaction. Compute the density-density correlation function $D(l,l^{\prime})$ of the LEG within the RPA using matrix notation. The Coulomb interaction serves as the self-energy term in the Dyson equation, as described in step . Vacuum dielectric constant $\epsilon_0 = 55.26349406 e^2 eV^{-1} \mu m^{-1}$ [<u>duplicate LEG_Dyson equation-bulk step </u>]
Background
The Dyson equation takes the form:
$$\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{D}_0 + \mathbf{D}_0\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{D}$$
