PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Based on the doping concentrations given ($N_a$ and $N_d$) and the intrinsic density $n_i$, compute the built-in bias of n-type and p-type regions $\phi_p$ and $\phi_n$. The thermal potential in room temperature is 0.0259V.
Background
For Boltzmann statistics, the relation between doping density and Fermi level is

$n=N_c\times exp(-\frac{E_c-E_{f,n}}{k_BT})$

$p=N_v\times exp(-\frac{E_{f,p}-E_v}{k_BT})$

where $E_c$ and $E_v$ is the conduction band and valence band energy, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, $N_c$ and $N_v$ are the effective density of states for electrons and holes (assume to be equal for this problem).

For constant doping, the built-in bias is provided as:

$\phi_p=E_i-E_{f,p}=kT\cdot ln(\frac{N_a}{n_i})$

$\phi_n=E_{f,n}-E_i=kT\cdot ln(\frac{N_d}{n_i})$

def Fermi(N_a, N_d, n_i):
    '''This function computes the Fermi levels of the n-type and p-type regions.
    Inputs:
    N_d: float, doping concentration in n-type region # cm^{-3}
    N_a: float, doping concentration in p-type region # cm^{-3}
    n_i: float, intrinsic carrier density # cm^{-3}
    Outputs:
    phi_p: float, built-in bias in p-type region (compare to E_i)
    phi_n: float, built-in bias in n-type region (compare to E_i)
    '''

    return phi_p, phi_n

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
