PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Construct the spatial differential operator a: Partial Derivative $\partial_i$. The first differential operator we want is a simple partial derivative: given an array of field values on 3d meshes, compute the partial derivates and return $\partial_x f(x,y,z)$, $\partial_y f(x,y,z)$ and $\partial_z f(x,y,z)$. We need a second order finite difference operator and on the boundary please use one-sided second-order expression.



print('Hello, World!')


------

Construct the spatial differential operator b: Laplacian $\nabla^2 = \partial_i \partial^i$. Take the laplacian calculation for a field on 3d meshes. Please implement the second order finite difference. Only output the value in the interior grids and make sure the output boundary values are zero.



print('Hello, World!')


------

Construct the spatial differential operator c: Gradient $\nabla_i f$ of Maxwell equations. Take the gradient calculation for a field on 3d meshes, that is calculate $\partial_x f, \partial_y f, \partial_z f$.  Please implement the second order finite difference. Only output the value in the interior grids and make sure the output boundary values are zero. Assume the grid length is the same in all dimensions.



print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Construct the spatial differential operator d: Divergence $\nabla_i v^i$ of Maxwell equations. Please implement the second order finite difference for a vector fields on 3d meshes. Only output the value in the interior grids and make sure the output boundary values are zero. Assume the grid length is the same in all dimensions and take the grid length as a input in the function.
