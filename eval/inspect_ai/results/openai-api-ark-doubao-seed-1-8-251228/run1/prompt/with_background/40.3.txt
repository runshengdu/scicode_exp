PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a function calculating second order derivatives using center symmetric scheme with second order accuracy. Using ghost cells with values equal to nearest cell on the boundary.
Background:
Centered second order differentiate operator:

$$
f^{\prime \prime}(x): \quad\{f(x+\Delta x)-2 f(x)+f(x-\Delta x)\} / \Delta x^2
$$


print('Hello, World!')

Write a function performing first order strang splitting at each time step
Background
The accuracy of the splitting method discussed in the section on Ordinary Operator Splitting for ODEs can
be enhanced from $O(\Delta t)$ to $O(\Delta t^2)$ by employing Strang splitting.
This method involves taking a half-step with the $f_0$ operator, a full step with the $f_1$ operator,
and then another half-step with the $f_0$ operator.
Over a time interval $\Delta t$, the algorithm can be expressed as follows.

\begin{aligned}
\frac{d \hat{u}}{d t} & =f_0\left(\hat{u}\right), \quad \hat{u}\left(t_n\right)=u\left(t_n\right), \quad t \in\left[t_n, t_n+\frac{1}{2} \Delta t\right] \\
\frac{d \tilde{u}}{d t} & =f_1\left(\tilde{u}\right), \quad \tilde{u}\left(t_n\right)=\hat{u}\left(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}\right), \quad t \in\left[t_n, t_n+\Delta t\right] \\
\frac{d \check{u}}{d t} & =f_0\left(\check{u}\right), \quad \check{u}\left(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\right)=\tilde{u}\left(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}\right), \quad t \in\left[t_{n+\frac{1}{2}} \Delta t, t_n+\Delta t\right]
\end{aligned}


print('Hello, World!')
