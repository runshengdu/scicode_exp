PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Wrap to periodic boundaries
Implementing a Python function named `wrap`. This function should apply periodic boundary conditions to the coordinates of a particle inside a cubic simulation box.
Background:
To implement PBC, the unit cell is surrounded by translated copies in all directions to approximate an infinitely large system. When one molecule diffuses across the boundary of the simulation box it reappears on the opposite side. So each molecule always interacts with its neighbours even though they may be on opposite sides of the simulation box


def wrap(r, L):
    '''Apply periodic boundary conditions to a vector of coordinates r for a cubic box of size L.
    Parameters:
    r : The (x, y, z) coordinates of a particle.
    L (float): The length of each side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    coord: numpy 1d array of floats, the wrapped coordinates such that they lie within the cubic box.
    '''
    r_np = np.asarray(r)
    coord = np.mod(r_np, L)
    return coord


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Energy of a single particle

 Implementing a Python function `E_i` to calculate the total Lennard-Jones potential energy of a particle due to its interactions with multiple other particles in a periodic cubic box. Apply minimum image convention. 'E_i' contains a  subfunction "E_ij", which computes the Lennard-Jones Potential between pair of atoms.
Background
The Lennard-Jones potential models soft repulsive and attractive (van der Waals) interactions. Hence, the Lennard-Jones potential describes electronically neutral atoms or molecules. The commonly used expression for the Lennard-Jones potential is:

$V^{tr-sh}_{LJ}(r) =
\begin{cases}
V_{LJ}(r) , & \text{if } r < r_c\\
0, & \text{if } r > r_c
\end{cases}
$

$
V_{LJ}(r) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{6} \right].
$

where r is the distance between two interacting particles, epsilon is the depth of the potential well (usually referred to as 'dispersion energy'), and sigma is the distance at which the particle-particle potential energy V is zero (often referred to as 'size of the particle').

The potential is truncated and shifted at a distance $ r_c $ to ensure the interaction energy becomes zero for $ r > r_c $, simplifying the force computations.

def E_i(r, pos, sigma, epsilon, L, r_c):
    '''Calculate the total Lennard-Jones potential energy of a particle with other particles in a periodic system.
    Parameters:
    r : array, the (x, y, z) coordinates of the target particle.
    pos : An array of (x, y, z) coordinates for each of the other particles in the system.
    sigma : float, the distance at which the potential minimum occurs
    epsilon : float, the depth of the potential well
    L : float, the length of the side of the cubic box
    r_c : float, cut-off distance
    Returns:
    float, the total Lennard-Jones potential energy of the particle due to its interactions with other particles.
    '''

    return E
