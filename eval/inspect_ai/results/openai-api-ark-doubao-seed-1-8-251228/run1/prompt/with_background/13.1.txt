PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Construct the spatial differential operator a: Partial Derivative $\partial_i$. The first differential operator we want is a simple partial derivative: given an array of field values on 3d meshes, compute the partial derivates and return $\partial_x f(x,y,z)$, $\partial_y f(x,y,z)$ and $\partial_z f(x,y,z)$. We need a second order finite difference operator and on the boundary please use one-sided second-order expression.


def partial_derivs_vec(fct, delta):
    '''Computes the partial derivatives of a scalar field in three dimensions using second-order finite differences.
    Parameters:
    -----------
    fct : numpy.ndarray
        A 3D array representing the scalar field values on the grid. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    delta : float
        The grid spacing or step size in each spatial direction.
    Returns:
    --------
    deriv_x : numpy.ndarray
        The partial derivative of the field with respect to the x direction (∂f/∂x).
    deriv_y : numpy.ndarray
        The partial derivative of the field with respect to the y direction (∂f/∂y).
    deriv_z : numpy.ndarray
        The partial derivative of the field with respect to the z direction (∂f/∂z).
    '''

    return deriv_x, deriv_y, deriv_z

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

from numpy import zeros, linspace, exp, sqrt
import numpy as np

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
