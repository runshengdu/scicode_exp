NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

The motion of a forced, damped single pendulum can be described by the second-order differential equation. Assuming the damping force is proportional to the angular velocity with coefficient $\beta$ and the external driving force *$A \cos(\alpha t)$* oscillates with time ($A$: drive amplitude, $\alpha$:drive frequency). Define the differential equations in python for this forced, damped Pendulum. The solution of this differential equation, $ y=[\theta, \omega]^T$, represents the state vector of the system, which includes the angle *$\theta$* and the angular velocity *$\omega$*. $\theta$ is measured in radians and $\omega$ in radians per second.
Background

A single pendulum consists of:
- A mass $m$ attached to the end of a string or rod of length $L$.
- The pivot point is frictionless.
- There is a damping force proportional to the angular velocity with a damping coefficient $\beta$.
- An external driving force $A \cos(\alpha t)$ oscillates with time.

(a) Identify the Forces and Torques

The forces acting on the pendulum bob are:
- Gravitational force $mg$ acting downward.
- Tension in the string (which does not do work as it acts along the string).
- Damping force proportional to the angular velocity $-\beta \frac{d\theta}{dt}$.
- External driving force $A \cos(\alpha t)$.

The torque $\tau$ around the pivot due to the gravitational force, damping force, and driving force is given by:

$$
\tau = -mgL \sin(\theta) - \beta L \frac{d\theta}{dt} + A \cos(\alpha t)
$$

The moment of inertia $I$ for a point mass $m$ at a distance $L$ from the pivot is:

$$
I = mL^2
$$

(b) Apply Newton's Second Law for Rotation

Using Newton's second law for rotation $\tau = I \alpha$:

$$
-mgL \sin(\theta) - \beta L \frac{d\theta}{dt} + A \cos(\alpha t) = mL^2 \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}
$$

(c) Simplify the Equation

Dividing both sides by $mL^2$:

$$
-\frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) - \frac{\beta}{mL} \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{A}{mL^2} \cos(\alpha t) = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}
$$

Rearranging the terms:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{\beta}{mL} \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) = \frac{A}{mL^2} \cos(\alpha t)
$$

(d) Converting to First-Order ODEs

To use numerical methods like RK4, we need to convert this second-order ODE into a system of first-order ODEs by defining:

$$
\frac{d\theta}{dt}= \omega
$$


Then, the first-order ODEs for this damped, forced single pendulum system becomes:

$$
\frac{d\omega}{dt} = -\frac{g}{L} \sin(\theta) - \frac{\beta}{mL} \omega+ \frac{A}{mL^2} \cos(\alpha t)
$$

(e) Define The State Vector

The state vector of this forced, damped pendulum is:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} \theta \\ \omega \end{pmatrix}
$$
