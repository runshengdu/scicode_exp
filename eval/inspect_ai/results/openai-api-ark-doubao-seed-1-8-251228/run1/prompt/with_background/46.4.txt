PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a Python class to implement a Slater wave function. The class contains functions to evaluate the unnormalized wave function psi, (gradient psi) / psi, (laplacian psi) / psi, and kinetic energy. Each function takes `configs` of shape `(nconfig, nelectrons, ndimensions)` as an input where: conf is the number of configurations, nelec is the number of electrons (2 for helium), ndim is the number of spatial dimensions (usually 3). The Slater wave function is given by $\exp(-\alpha r_1) \exp(-\alpha r_2)$.
Background

Slater

Define a simple wave function with exponential orbitals and no Jastrow factor.

**Value**

\begin{align}
\psi(r_1, r_2) &= \exp(-\alpha r_1) \exp(-\alpha r_2).
\end{align}

**Gradient**

\begin{align}
\frac{\nabla \psi}{\psi} &= -\alpha \left[\frac{\mathbf{r}_1 }{r_1}, \frac{\mathbf{r}_2}{r_2} \right]
\end{align}

**Laplacian**

\begin{align}
\frac{\nabla^2 \psi}{\psi} &= \left[-\frac{2 \alpha}{r_1} + \alpha^2, -\frac{2 \alpha}{r_2} + \alpha^2\right]
\end{align}


print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python class for Hamiltonian to evaluate electron-electron and electron-ion potentials of a helium atom from the given `configs`, which has shape (nconf, nelec, ndim) where nconf is the number of configurations, nelec is the number of electrons (2 for helium), ndim is the number of spatial dimensions (usually 3)
Background

The Hamiltonian is given by

\begin{align}
H &= -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_{1}^2 - \frac{1}{2} \nabla_{2}^2 - \frac{2}{r_1} - \frac{2}{r_2} + \frac{1}{r_{12}}.
\end{align}


print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python function that performs Metropolis algorithms given the electron positions `configs`, a WaveFunction object `wf`, and a Hamiltonian object `hamiltonian`, using timestep `tau`, and number of steps `nsteps`
Background

Given the current position $\mathbf{r} = \{\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2\}$, propose a new move 

\begin{align}
\mathbf{r}^{\prime} &= \mathbf{r} + \sqrt{\tau} \chi,
\end{align}

where $\chi$ is a random number from the standard normal distribution.

Accept the proposed move with the acceptance probability

\begin{align}
a &= \frac{|\psi(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})|^2}{|\psi(\mathbf{r})|^2}.
\end{align}


print('Hello, World!')
