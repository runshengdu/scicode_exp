PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a Python function to determine the alpha value for the Ewald summation given reciprocal lattice vectors `recvec` of shape (3, 3). Alpha is a parameter that controls the division of the summation into real and reciprocal space components and determines the width of the Gaussian charge distribution. Multiply the result by scaling `alpha_scaling` (fixed to 5).



print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python function to generate the tiled lattice coordinates from the `latvec` and `nlatvec` number of lattice cells to expand to in each of the 3D directions, i.e. from `-nlatvec` to `nlatvec + 1`. Return `lattice_coords` of shape ((2N+1)^3, 3)



print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python function to generate the distance matrix `distances` and pair indices `pair_idxs` from the given particle coordinates `configs` of shape (nparticles, 3). Return the distance vectors `distances` for each particle pair of shape (nparticles choose 2, 3) and `pair_idxs`, which is a list of pair indices.



print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python function to evaluate the real-space terms before doing the summation over particle pairs but make sure to sum over lattice cells as follows

\begin{align}
c_{ij} = \sum_{\mathbf{n}} \frac{\textrm{erfc} \left(  \alpha |\mathbf{r}_{ij} + \mathbf{n} L| \right)}{|\mathbf{r}_{ij} + \mathbf{n} L|}
\end{align}

Inputs are distance vectors `distances` of shape `(natoms, npairs, 1, 3)`, `lattice_coords` of shape `(natoms, 1, ncells, 3)`, and alpha.



print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python function to evaluate the real-space summation as follows, where `c_ij` is evaluated using `real_cij` function from .

\begin{align}
E_{\textrm{real-cross}} &= \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j>i}^N q_i q_j c_{ij}. \\
\end{align}



print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python function to generate all possible reciprocal-space points that include [0 to gmax] in x direction and [-gmax, gmax] in y and z directions (inclusive), i.e. four quardrants, where gmax is the integer number of lattice points to include in one positive direction. Make sure to exclude the origin (0, 0, 0), all the points where x=0, y=0, z<0, and all the points where x=0, y<0. Inputs are reciprocal lattie vectors `recvec` and `gmax`.



print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a Python function to calculate the following weight at each reciprocal space point. Return only points and weights that are larger than tolerance `tol` (fixed to 1e-10). Inputs are `gpoints_all`, `cell_volume`, `alpha`, `tol`.

\begin{align}
W(k) &= \frac{4 \pi}{V} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{k^2}{4 \alpha^2}}}{k^2} 
\end{align}


def select_big_weights(gpoints_all, cell_volume, alpha, tol=1e-10):
    '''Filter g-points based on weight in reciprocal space.
    Parameters:
        gpoints_all (np.ndarray): An array of shape (nk, 3) representing all g-points.
        cell_volume (float): The volume of the unit cell.
        alpha (float): The alpha value used for the Ewald summation.
        tol (float, optional): The tolerance for filtering weights. Default is 1e-10.
    Returns:
        tuple: 
            gpoints (np.array): An array of shape (nk, 3) containing g-points with significant weights.
            gweights (np.array): An array of shape (nk,) containing the weights of the selected g-points.       
    '''

    return gpoints, gweights
