PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Implement a function to get the KL-divergence of two probability distributions p and q, assuming they have the same support. Use log with base 2.
Background
The KL-divergence of two probaility distributions p and q on the same support is given by
$$
D(p||q) = \sum_x p(x)\log_2\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right).
$$
Note that we define $x\log_2 x$ to be 0 when $x=0$.


print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Given a classical channel and a prior input random variable, calculate the mutual information between the input random variable and the random variable associated with the output of the channel.
Background
A classical channel is modeled by a conditional probability distribution $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$. Given an input random variable with probability distribution $p_X(x)$, the joint distribution of the input X and output Y is $p_{XY}(x,y) = p_{Y|X}(y|x)p_X(x)$. The mutual information of the joint distribution is given by
$$
I(X;Y) = H(X)+H(Y)-H(XY)
$$
where $H(X)=-\sum_x p_X(x)\log_2 p_X(x)$, $H(Y)=-\sum_y p_Y(y)\log_2 p_Y(y)$, $H(XY)=-\sum_{x,y} p_{XY}(x,y)\log_2 p_{XY}(x,y)$. Note that we define $x\log_2 x$ to be 0 when $x=0$.

def mutual_info(channel, prior):
    '''Input
    channel: a classical channel, 2d array of floats; channel[i][j] means probability of i given j
    prior:   input random variable, 1d array of floats.
    Output
    mutual: mutual information between the input random variable and the random variable associated with the output of the channel, a single scalar value (float)
    '''

    return mutual
