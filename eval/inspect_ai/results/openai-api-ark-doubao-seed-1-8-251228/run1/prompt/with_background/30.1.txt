PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a Python class to implement a Slater wave function. The class contains functions to evaluate the unnormalized wave function psi, (gradient psi) / psi, (laplacian psi) / psi, and kinetic energy / psi. Each function takes `configs` of shape `(nconfig, nelectrons, ndimensions)` as an input where: conf is the number of configurations, nelec is the number of electrons (2 for helium), ndim is the number of spatial dimensions (usually 3). The Slater wave function is given by $\exp(-\alpha r_1) \exp(-\alpha r_2)$.
Background

Slater

Define a simple wave function with exponential orbitals and no Jastrow factor.

**Value**

\begin{align}
\psi(r_1, r_2) &= \exp(-\alpha r_1) \exp(-\alpha r_2).
\end{align}

**Gradient**

\begin{align}
\frac{\nabla \psi}{\psi} &= -\alpha \left[\frac{\mathbf{r}_1 }{r_1}, \frac{\mathbf{r}_2}{r_2} \right]
\end{align}

**Laplacian**

\begin{align}
\frac{\nabla^2 \psi}{\psi} &= \left[-\frac{2 \alpha}{r_1} + \alpha^2, -\frac{2 \alpha}{r_2} + \alpha^2\right]
\end{align}

class Slater:
    def __init__(self, alpha):
        '''Args: 
            alpha: exponential decay factor
        '''
    def value(self, configs):
        '''Calculate unnormalized psi
        Args:
            configs (np.array): electron coordinates of shape (nconf, nelec, ndim)
        Returns:
            val (np.array): (nconf,)
        '''
    def gradient(self, configs):
        '''Calculate (gradient psi) / psi
        Args:
            configs (np.array): electron coordinates of shape (nconf, nelec, ndim)
        Returns:
            grad (np.array): (nconf, nelec, ndim)
        '''
    def laplacian(self, configs):
        '''Calculate (laplacian psi) / psi
        Args:
            configs (np.array): electron coordinates of shape (nconf, nelec, ndim)
        Returns:
            lap (np.array): (nconf, nelec)
        '''
    def kinetic(self, configs):
        '''Calculate the kinetic energy / psi
        Args:
            configs (np.array): electron coordinates of shape (nconf, nelec, ndim)
        Returns:
            kin (np.array): (nconf,)
        '''

        return kin

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
