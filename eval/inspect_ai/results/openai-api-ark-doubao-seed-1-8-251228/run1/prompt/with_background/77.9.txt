PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Wrap to periodic boundaries
Implementing a Python function named `wrap`. This function should apply periodic boundary conditions to the coordinates of a particle inside a cubic simulation box.
Background:
To implement PBC, the unit cell is surrounded by translated copies in all directions to approximate an infinitely large system. When one molecule diffuses across the boundary of the simulation box it reappears on the opposite side. So each molecule always interacts with its neighbours even though they may be on opposite sides of the simulation box

Minimum Image Distance Function

Implementing Python function named `dist` that calculates the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
Background:
The function should implement the minimum image convention, which is used in molecular dynamics simulations to consider the shortest distance between periodic images of particles.

Minimum Image Vector Function

Implementing Python function named `dist_v` that calculates the minimum image vector between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
Background:
The function should implement the minimum image convention, which is used in molecular dynamics simulations to consider the shortest distance between periodic images of particles.

Lennard-Jones Potential

Implementing a Python function named `E_ij` to get Lennard-Jones potential with potential well depth epislon that reaches zero at distance sigma between pair of atoms with distance r. which is truncated and shifted to zero at a cutoff distance `rc`.
Background
The Lennard-Jones potential models soft repulsive and attractive (van der Waals) interactions. Hence, the Lennard-Jones potential describes electronically neutral atoms or molecules. The commonly used expression for the Lennard-Jones potential is:

$V^{tr-sh}_{LJ}(r) =
\begin{cases}
V_{LJ}(r)-V_{LJ}(r_c), & \text{if } r < r_c\\
0, & \text{if } r > r_c
\end{cases}
$

$
V_{LJ}(r) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{6} \right].
$

$
V_{LJ}(r_c) = 4\epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^{6} \right].
$


where r is the distance between two interacting particles, epsilon is the depth of the potential well (usually referred to as 'dispersion energy'), and sigma is the distance at which the particle-particle potential energy V is zero (often referred to as 'size of the particle').

The potential is truncated and shifted at a distance $ r_c $ to ensure the interaction energy becomes zero for $ r > r_c $, simplifying the force computations.

Lennard-Jones Force

 Based on Lennard-Jones potential with potential well depth epislon that reaches zero at distance sigma, write a function that calculates the forces between two particles whose three dimensional displacement is r.
Background
To get force, we just use the negative gradiant of Lennard-Jones potential (by definition):

$\vec{F}=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial \vec{r}}=-\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} ; \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} ; \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}\right)$

Tail Corrections for Energy with LJ

Implementing Python functions named `E_tail` to calculate the tail correction  for a system of particles within a cubic simulation box. This correction accounts for the truncation of the Lennard-Jones potentials at a specific cutoff distance.
Background

In molecular dynamics simulations, long-range interactions are often neglected beyond a cutoff radius $ r_c $. To estimate the contribution of these neglected interactions to the system's energy, tail correction is applied. The energy tail correction per particle is given by:

$
u^{\textbf{tail LJ}}_{i} = \frac{8}{3} \pi N^2 \epsilon \sigma^3 \left[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^9 - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^3 \right]
$

Tail Corrections for Pressure with LJ

Implementing Python functions named `P_tail` to calculate the tail correction for a system of particles within a cubic simulation box. This correction accounts for the truncation of the Lennard-Jones potentials at a specific cutoff distance.
Background

In molecular dynamics simulations, long-range interactions are often neglected beyond a cutoff radius $ r_c $. To estimate the contribution of these neglected interactions to the system's pressure, tail correction is applied. The pressure tail correction for the system, considering all particles, is:

$
p^{\text{tail LJ}} = \frac{16}{3} \pi N^2 \epsilon \sigma^3 \left[ \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^9 - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r_c} \right)^3 \right]
$

Potential Energy
Implementing a Python function named `E_pot` to calculate the total potential energy of a system of particles.
Background

The pairwise potential energy $ E_{ij} $ for particles separated by a distance less than the cutoff radius $ r_c $ is calculated using the `E_ij` function, which should be provided. A helper function `dist` should be used to calculate the distance between two particles, applying the minimum image convention.

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Temperature Calculation

Implement Python function to calculate instantaneous temperature of a system of particles in molecular dynamics simulation. The temperature function, named `temperature`, should use the kinetic energy to determine the instantaneous temperature of the system according to the equipartition theorem, with the temperature returned in Kelvin. Note that the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ is 0.0138064852 zJ/K.
Background

Temperature Calculation via Equipartition Theorem

For the `temperature` function, the temperature is calculated using the relationship:

$$ E_{kinetic} = \frac{3}{2}k_BT $$

Where \(E_{kinetic}\) is the average kinetic energy per particle and \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant.

the kinetic energy for each particle is given by:

$$ E_{kinetic} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

Where $v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2$ is the square of the velocity vector. Remember to account for Avogadro's number when converting from molar mass to the mass of a single particle.
