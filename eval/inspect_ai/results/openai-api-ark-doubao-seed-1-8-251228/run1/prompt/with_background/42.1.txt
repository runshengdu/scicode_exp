PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Provide a function to calculate the peak gain coefficient with the information given. The inputs are the quantum well number ($n_w$), injection quantum efficiency ($\eta$), optical confinement factor ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{w}}$), cavity length (L in cm), intrinsic loss ($\alpha$) and facets' reflection coefficients (R), and the output should be the gain coefficient $G_{th}$ at threshold condition.
Background
For an MQW structure with $n_{\mathrm{w}}$ quantum wells and a cavity length $L$, the required modal gain $G_{\text {th }}$ at threshold condition is

$$
G_{\mathrm{th}}=n_{\mathrm{w}} \Gamma_{\mathrm{w}} g_{\mathrm{w}}=\alpha+\frac{1}{2 L} \ln \frac{1}{R_1 R_2}
$$

where $g_w$ is the peak gain coefficient of a single QW structure, $\alpha$ is the internal optical loss, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{w}}$ is the optical confinement factor per well, and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the optical power reflection coefficients at both facets.

def gain(nw, Gamma_w, alpha, L, R1, R2):
    '''Calculates the single peak gain coefficient g_w.
    Input:
    nw (float): Quantum well number.
    Gamma_w (float): Confinement factor of the waveguide.
    alpha (float): Internal loss coefficient in cm^-1.
    L (float): Cavity length in cm.
    R1 (float): The reflectivities of mirror 1.
    R2 (float): The reflectivities of mirror 2.
    Output:
    gw (float): Gain coefficient g_w.
    '''

    return gw
