PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Use Monte Carlo method to find the thermal equilibrium state given an inital state and given interaction coefficients $J_{ij}$. If using functions from np.random, only "randint" and "rand" are allowed in this part.
Background
Considered as the simpliest model of spin glass, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian is given by:
$$
H_{SK} = -\sum_{i < j} J_{ij}\sigma_i \sigma_j
$$
assuming the absence of a external magtetic field and full connection between all the spins.
In this Monte Carlo simulation, we should use Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to find the equilibrium state.


print('Hello, World!')


------

In the replica method, given an emsemble of replicas at thermal equilibrium, calculate the overlaps of the replicas and return the results in ascending order.
Background
Replica symmetry breaking can be detected using the Parisi overlap fucntion. For two replicas, $R_a$ and $R_b$, the overlap between them is calculated as
$$
\frac{R_a^T\cdot R_b}{N}
$$


print('Hello, World!')


------

To determine if replica symmetry breaking occurs, analyze the overall overlap distribution of the system.
Background
If the system maintains replica symmetry, the overlap values should follow a normal distribution peaked around $0$ with a standard deviation $1/\sqrt{N}$. A broader distribution or multi-modal behavior indicates potential replica symmetry breaking. Note that intrinsic fluctuations and finite-size effects can cause small deviations from the expected Gaussian peak even when the replica symmetry is intact; allow some reasonable deviation in the judging criterion.


print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a numerical simulation of the SK model with size N at temperature $T$. Use the replica method to sample the equilibrium state distribution. Find the overlap distribution of replicas from all realizations and identify if replica symmetry breaking occurs. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the overall overlap distribution. If using functions from np.random, only "randn" and "choice" are allowed in this part.
Background
In the SK model, we randomly sample the coupling coefficient $J$, which represents quenched disorder in the spin glass. Here, $J_{ij}\equiv n_{ij}/\sqrt{N}$, and $n_{ij}$'s are i.i.d. from $N(0,1)$. For each $J$, create many replicas of the system by randomly choose $\sigma_i\in\{\pm 1\}$ as the starting state and find the equilibrium states using Monte Carlo method.

    '''Simulation the SK model using replica method, analyze overlap and identify potential replica symmetry breaking
    Input:
    N: size of spin system, int
    T: temprature, float
    num_steps: number of sampling steps per spin in the Monte Carlo simulation, int

    num_realizations: number of realizations to sample different J's, int
    Output:
    potential_RSB: True if potential RSB is indicated, False otherwise, boolean
    mean: mean of the overall overlap distribution, float
    std: standard deviation of the overall overlap distribution, float
