PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Construct the spatial differential operator a: Partial Derivative $\partial_i$. The first differential operator we want is a simple partial derivative: given an array of field values on 3d meshes, compute the partial derivates and return $\partial_x f(x,y,z)$, $\partial_y f(x,y,z)$ and $\partial_z f(x,y,z)$. We need a second order finite difference operator and on the boundary please use one-sided second-order expression.



print('Hello, World!')


------

Construct the spatial differential operator b: Laplacian $\nabla^2 = \partial_i \partial^i$. Take the laplacian calculation for a field on 3d meshes. Please implement the second order finite difference. Only output the value in the interior grids and make sure the output boundary values are zero.



print('Hello, World!')


------

Construct the spatial differential operator c: Gradient $\nabla_i f$ of Maxwell equations. Take the gradient calculation for a field on 3d meshes, that is calculate $\partial_x f, \partial_y f, \partial_z f$.  Please implement the second order finite difference. Only output the value in the interior grids and make sure the output boundary values are zero. Assume the grid length is the same in all dimensions.



print('Hello, World!')


------

Construct the spatial differential operator d: Divergence $\nabla_i v^i$ of Maxwell equations. Please implement the second order finite difference for a vector fields on 3d meshes. Only output the value in the interior grids and make sure the output boundary values are zero. Assume the grid length is the same in all dimensions and take the grid length as a input in the function.



print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Construct the spatial differential operator e: Gradient of Divergence $\nabla_i (\nabla_j v^j)$. Please use the second order finite difference to calculate the gradient of the divergence of a vector fields. The fields are on a 3d mesh with the same grid length. Please note by first taking a divergence and then apply the gradient will result in larger error. Need to work out a finite difference formula for this operator.
Background

If we want to calculate the x gradient of divergence of vector field A then, we need to calculate 
$$
\partial_x (\partial_j A^j)  = \partial_x \partial_x A^x + \partial_x\partial_y A^{y} + \partial_x\partial_z A^z
$$
the first term is the second derivative of $A^x$, the last two terms are mixed second derivatives and can also be implemented in second order finite difference as 
$$
(\partial_x \partial_y A^y)_{ijk} = \frac{1}{4\Delta^2}(A^y_{i+1,j+1,k} - A^y_{i-1,j+1,k} - A^y_{i+1,j-1,k} + A^y_{i-1,j-1,k})
$$
with $\Delta$ denoting the grid length.
