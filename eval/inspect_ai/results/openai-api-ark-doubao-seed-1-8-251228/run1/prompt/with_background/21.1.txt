PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Compute the density of states (DOS) **relative** effective mass $m_r$ (unitless)of $Al_xGa_{1-x}As$, given the effective electron mass $m_e$, heavy hole mass $m_{hh}$ and light hole mass $m_{lh}$. Take in the functions of the corresponding effective masses in the table. For $Al_xGa_{1-x}As$, $m_e = (0.0637 + 0.083 * x) * m_0$, $m_{lh} = (0.087 + 0.063 * x) * m_0$ and $m_{hh} = (0.50 + 0.29 * x) * m_0$.
Background
For density of states effective mass is

$\begin{gathered}m_r^{l h}=\left(\frac{1}{m_e}+\frac{1}{m_{l h}}\right)^{-1}, m_r^{h h}=\left(\frac{1}{m_e}+\frac{1}{m_{h h}}\right)^{-1} \\ \left(m_r\right)^{3 / 2}=\left(m_r^{l h}\right)^{3 / 2}+\left(m_r^{h h}\right)^{3 / 2}\end{gathered}$

where all the masses are assumed to be linear of the composition $x$.

def m_eff(x, m0):
    '''Calculates the effective mass of GaAlAs for a given aluminum mole fraction x.
    Input:
    x (float): Aluminum mole fraction in GaAlAs.
    m0 (float): electron rest mass (can be reduced to 1 as default).
    Output:
    mr (float): Effective mass of GaAlAs.
    '''

    return mr

DEPENDENCIES:

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
