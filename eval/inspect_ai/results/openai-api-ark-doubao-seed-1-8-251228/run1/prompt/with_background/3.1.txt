PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Create a function to solve the matrix equation $Ax=b$ using the Gauss-Seidel iteration. The function takes a matrix $A$ and a vector $b$ as inputs. The method involves splitting the matrix $A$ into the difference of two matrices, $A=M-N$. For Gauss-Seidel, $M=D-L$, where $D$ is the diagonal component of $A$ and $L$ is the lower triangular component of $A$. The function should implement the corresponding iterative solvers until the norm of the increment is less than the given tolerance, $||x_k - x_{k-1}||_{l_2}<\epsilon$.
Background
Gauss-Seidel is considered as a fixed-point iterative solver.
Convergence is guaranteed when A is diagonally dominant or symmetric positive definite.

\begin{equation}
x_{i}^{(k+1)} = \frac{b_i - \sum_{j>i} a_{ij}x_j^{(k)} - \sum_{j<i} a_{ij} x_j^{(k+1)}}{a_{ii}}
\end{equation}

def GS(A, b, eps, x_true, x0):
    '''Solve a given linear system Ax=b Gauss-Seidel iteration
    Input
    A:      N by N matrix, 2D array
    b:      N by 1 right hand side vector, 1D array
    eps:    Float number indicating error tolerance
    x_true: N by 1 true solution vector, 1D array
    x0:     N by 1 zero vector, 1D array
    Output
    residual: Float number shows L2 norm of residual (||Ax - b||_2)
    errors:   Float number shows L2 norm of error vector (||x-x_true||_2) 
    '''

    return residual, error
