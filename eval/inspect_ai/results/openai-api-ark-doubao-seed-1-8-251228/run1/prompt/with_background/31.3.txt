PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a Python function to standardize (center and divide SD) the mixture matrix `X` of shape `(nmixtures, time)` along the row. Return a centered matrix `D` of the same shape



print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python function to whiten the mixture matrix `X`. Make sure to center `X` along the rows first. Return the whitened matrix `Z`. The covariance of `Z` must be an identity matrix.



print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a Python function to perform independent component analysis. The function takes the mixture matrix `X` of shape `(nmixtures, time)` as an input. Whiten `X` before the operation. Find the unmixing matrix `W` of shape `(nmixtures, nmixtures)` by starting from a random vector `w` and iterating over `cycles` to orthogonally find a transformation component `w_rowidx` in Newton's method `w_new = E[x g(w_curr dot x)] - w_curr E[dg (w_curr dot x]` for that component. Define `g(x) = tanh(x)` and `dg(x) = 1 - g(x)^2`. Terminate the algorithm when `np.abs(np.abs(w @ w_new) - 1)` is less than the input `tol` or when iteration goes over max `cycles`. Repeat this process until the matrix `W` is defined for all rows. Return the predicted sources `S` of shape `(nmixtures, time)` after finding `W` matrix by `S = W @ X_whitened`.


def ica(X, cycles, tol):
    '''Perform independent component analysis 
    Args:
        X (np.array): mixture matrix. Shape (nmix, time)
        cycles (int): number of max possible iterations 
        tol (float): convergence tolerance
    Returns:
        S_hat (np.array): predicted independent sources. Shape (nmix, time)
    '''

    return S_hat

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

import numpy as np

from scipy import signal

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
