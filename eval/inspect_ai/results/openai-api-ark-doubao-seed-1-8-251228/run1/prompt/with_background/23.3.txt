PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Implement a function to get the KL-divergence of two probability distributions p and q, assuming they have the same support. Use log with base 2.
Background
The KL-divergence of two probaility distributions p and q on the same support is given by
$$
D(p||q) = \sum_x p(x)\log_2\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right).
$$
Note that we define $x\log_2 x$ to be 0 when $x=0$.


print('Hello, World!')

Given a classical channel and a prior input random variable, calculate the mutual information between the input random variable and the random variable associated with the output of the channel.
Background
A classical channel is modeled by a conditional probability distribution $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$. Given an input random variable with probability distribution $p_X(x)$, the joint distribution of the input X and output Y is $p_{XY}(x,y) = p_{Y|X}(y|x)p_X(x)$. The mutual information of the joint distribution is given by
$$
I(X;Y) = H(X)+H(Y)-H(XY)
$$
where $H(X)=-\sum_x p_X(x)\log_2 p_X(x)$, $H(Y)=-\sum_y p_Y(y)\log_2 p_Y(y)$, $H(XY)=-\sum_{x,y} p_{XY}(x,y)\log_2 p_{XY}(x,y)$. Note that we define $x\log_2 x$ to be 0 when $x=0$.


print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Use the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to numerically calculate the channel capacity of a classical channel. The channel is given as a 2d array of floats. In each interation of the algorithm, if the difference between the updated rate and the original rate is less than the error threshold, the algorithm breaks. The error threshold is given as a float. The output is the channel capacity which is a float.
Background
The algorithm begins with a random prior distribution. In each step of the algorithm, the prior distribution follows the following update rule.
$$
p_{new}(x) = p_{old}(x)\frac{\exp(D(p(Y|x)||p(Y))}{\sum_{x'}p_{old}(x')\exp(D(p(Y|x')||p(Y))}
$$
where $p_{old}(x)$ is the old prior input distribution, $p_{new}$ is the updated prior input distribution, $p(Y|x)$ is the probability distribution of the output conditioned on the input symbol being $x$, and $p(Y)$ is the probability distribution of the output if input distribution is the old prior distribution. $D(p(Y|x)||p(Y))$ is the KL-divergence of probability distributions $p(Y|x)$ and $p(Y)$.

def blahut_arimoto(channel, e):
    '''Input
    channel: a classical channel, 2d array of floats; Channel[i][j] means probability of i given j
    e:       error threshold, a single scalar value (float)
    Output
    rate_new: channel capacity, a single scalar value (float)
    '''

    return rate_new
