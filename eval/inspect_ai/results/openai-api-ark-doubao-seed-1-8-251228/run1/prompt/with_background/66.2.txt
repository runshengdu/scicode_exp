PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a Python function to generate a monolayer graphene geometry. Inputs are `s` sliding distance in the y-direction, `a` lattice constants, `z` z-coordinate, and `n` number of lattice sites to generate in negative and positive directions for both x and y axes. Make sure the armchair direction is along the y-axis and the zigzag direction is along the x-axis.



def generate_monolayer_graphene(s, a, z, n):
    '''Generate the geometry of monolayer graphene.
    Args:
        s (float): Horizontal in-plane sliding distance.
        a (float): Lattice constant.
        z (float): z-coordinate
        n (int): supercell size
    Returns:
        atoms (np.array): Array containing the x, y, and z coordinates of the atoms.
    '''
    # Generate grid of indices for supercell expansion
    i = np.arange(-n, n + 1)
    j = np.arange(-n, n + 1)
    i_grid, j_grid = np.meshgrid(i, j, indexing='ij')
    
    # Calculate coordinates for sublattice A
    x_a = (a * np.sqrt(3) / 2) * (i_grid + j_grid)
    y_a = (a / 2) * (j_grid - i_grid) + s
    z_a = np.full_like(x_a, z)
    
    # Calculate coordinates for sublattice B (shifted in x-direction relative to A)
    x_b = x_a + (a * np.sqrt(3) / 3)
    y_b = y_a
    z_b = z_a
    
    # Reshape and concatenate both sublattices into a single array
    atoms_a = np.stack([x_a.ravel(), y_a.ravel(), z_a.ravel()], axis=1)
    atoms_b = np.stack([x_b.ravel(), y_b.ravel(), z_b.ravel()], axis=1)
    atoms = np.concatenate([atoms_a, atoms_b], axis=0)
    
    return atoms


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a Python function `assign_normals` to assign a normal vector for each atom. A normal vector at an atom is defined by averaging the 3 normalized cross products of vectors from this atom to its 3 nearest neighbors. Input is `xyzs` of shape `(natoms, 3)`. Return the normalized normal vectors of shape `(natoms,)`. Make sure that this vector is pointing in the negative z-direction for atoms with z > 0, and in the positive z-direction for atoms with z < 0. Correct normal vectors in the wrong direction by multiplying by -


def assign_normals(xyzs):
    '''Assign normal vectors on the given atoms
    Args:
        xyzs (np.array): Shape (natoms, 3)
    Returns:
        normed_cross_avg (np.array): Shape (natoms,)
    '''

    return normed_cross_avg

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
