PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Evaluate the Moon and Koshino hopping $-t(\mathbf{R}_i, \mathbf{R}_j)$ from given $\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{R}_i-\mathbf{R}_j$. $\mathbf{z}$ is perpendicular to the graphene plane.

\begin{align}
-t(\mathbf{R}_i, \mathbf{R}_j) &= V_{pp\pi} \left[1 - \left(\frac{d_z}{d}\right)^2 \right]
+ V_{pp\sigma} \left(\frac{d_z}{d}\right)^2. \\
V_{pp\pi} &= V_{pp\pi}^0 \exp \left[-b(d - a_0)\right] \\
V_{pp\sigma} &= V_{pp\sigma}^0 \exp \left[-b(d - d_0)\right]
\end{align}

using
$V_{pp\pi}^0 = v_{p_0}$ = -2.7 eV, $V_{pp\sigma}^0 = v_{s_0}$ = 0.48 eV, $b$ = (b,a.u.)$^{-1}$, $a_0$ = 2.68 b, a.u., $d_0$ = 6.33 b, a.u.



print('Hello, World!')
