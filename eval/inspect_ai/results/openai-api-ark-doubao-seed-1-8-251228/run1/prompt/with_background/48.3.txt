PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Convert diffractometer angles to the in-plane momentum transfer, $q$, and to the out-of-plane momenta of the incident and scattered electron, $k_i^z$ and $k_s^z$. Momentum transfer $Q$ is defined as $Q = \vec{k_s} - \vec{k_i}$. Assume the sample surface normal is along the $+z$ direction and the scattering plane lies in the $x-z$ plane. $k_i^z$ is along the $+z$ direction, $k_s^z$ is along the $-z$ direction, and $k_i^x$, $k_s^x$ are along the $+x$ direction. Using the electron mass $m_e = 0.51099895 $ MeV/$c^2$ and Planck's constant $hc = 1239.84193$ eV nm
Background 
electron momentum in the nonrelativistic limit is given by:
$$k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}$$
where $E$ is the electron energy and $m$ is the mass of a stationary electron.

------

Calculate Coulomb matrix element, $V_{\mathrm{eff}} (\tilde{Q})$, from the diffractometer angles. The effective Coulomb interaction is expressed in reciprocal space at momentum $\tilde{Q} = (q,\kappa)$ where $\kappa = k_i^z + k_s^z$
Background 
Coulomb matrix element in the low $q$ limit, $q \sim 0$, is given by:
$$V_{\mathrm{eff}}(q) = \dfrac{4\pi e^2}{q^2+(k_i^z + k_s^z)^2}$$

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Convert $I(\omega)$ to the density-density correlation function, $S(\omega)$. In the low $q$ limit, the cross section is proportional to $V_{\mathrm{eff}}^2S(\omega)$
Background 
In the low $q$ limit, M-EELS cross section is given by:
$$\frac{\partial^2\sigma}{\partial\Omega\partial E} = \sigma_0 V_{\mathrm{eff}}^2S(\omega)$$
where $\sigma_0$ can be approximated as a constant

def S_cal(omega, I, th, gamma, E0):
    '''Convert the experimental data to density-density correlation function, where \sigma_0 = 1 
    Input 
    omega, energy loss, a list of float in the unit of eV
    I, measured cross section from the detector in the unit of Hz, a list of float
    th, angle between the incident electron and the sample surface normal is 90-th, a list of float in the unit of degree
    gamma, angle between the incident and scattered electron, a list of float in the unit of degree
    E0, incident electron energy, float in the unit of eV
    Output
    S_omega: density-density correlation function, a list of float
    '''

    return S_omega
