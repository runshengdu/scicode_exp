PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a Python function to determine the alpha value for the Ewald summation given reciprocal lattice vectors `recvec` of shape (3, 3). Alpha is a parameter that controls the division of the summation into real and reciprocal space components and determines the width of the Gaussian charge distribution. Multiply the result by scaling `alpha_scaling` (fixed to 5).



print('Hello, World!')


------

Write a Python function to generate the tiled lattice coordinates from the `latvec` and `nlatvec` number of lattice cells to expand to in each of the 3D directions, i.e. from `-nlatvec` to `nlatvec + 1`. Return `lattice_coords` of shape ((2N+1)^3, 3)



print('Hello, World!')


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a Python function to generate the distance matrix `distances` and pair indices `pair_idxs` from the given particle coordinates `configs` of shape (nparticles, 3). Return the distance vectors `distances` for each particle pair of shape (nparticles choose 2, 3) and `pair_idxs`, which is a list of pair indices.


def distance_matrix(configs):
    '''Args:
        configs (np.array): (nparticles, 3)
    Returns:
        distances (np.array): distance vector for each particle pair. Shape (npairs, 3), where npairs = (nparticles choose 2)
        pair_idxs (list of tuples): list of pair indices
    '''

    return distances, pair_idxs

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

import numpy as np
from scipy.special import erfc

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
