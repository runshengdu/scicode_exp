PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Determine the generated electron distribution ($n$) as a function of the depth $x$, given the incident optical power $P$, beam area $A$ in $\mu m^2$, incident wavelength $\lambda_i$, the electron lifetime $\tau$ and the corresponding absorption coefficient $\alpha$. The speed of light is $3\times 10^{8} m/s$, and the Planck constant is $6.626\times 10^{-34} J\cdot s$.
Background

The steady state generated carrier concentration, neglecting diffusion is solved for by setting

$R_{generation}=R_{recombination}$.

For constant lifetime,

$\Delta N=R_{generation}τ$.

Because the excess charge is due to optical power,

$R_{generation}=\frac{1}{Area}*\frac{1}{hν}*(-\frac{dP}{dx})$,

here $\frac{1}{h\nu}$ converts optical power into photon number.

From the absorption constant,

$P(x)=P_0e^{-\alpha x}$.

Therefore, we get

$\Delta N(x)=\frac{\tau \alpha P_0e^{-\alpha x}}{Ah\nu}$.

def generation(P, A, lambda_i, alpha, tau, x):
    '''This function computes the excess electron distribution.
    Input:
    P (float): incident optical power in W
    A (float): beam area in μm^2
    lambda_i (float): incident wavelength in nm
    alpha (float): absorption coefficient in cm^-1
    tau (float): lifetime of excess carriers in s
    x (float): depth variable in μm
    Output:
    dN (float): generated carrier density in cm^-3
    '''

    return dN
