PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a function calculating second order derivatives using center symmetric scheme with second order accuracy. Using ghost cells with values equal to nearest cell on the boundary.
Background:
Centered second order differentiate operator:

$$
f^{\prime \prime}(x): \quad\{f(x+\Delta x)-2 f(x)+f(x-\Delta x)\} / \Delta x^2
$$


def second_diff(target, u, dx):
    '''Inputs:
    target : Target cell index, int
    u      : Approximated solution value, array of floats with minimum length of 5
    dx     : Spatial interval, float
    Outputs:
    deriv  : Second order derivative of the given target cell, float
    '''
    n = len(u)
    # Get left neighbor value (handle boundary with ghost cell)
    left = u[target - 1] if target > 0 else u[0]
    # Get right neighbor value (handle boundary with ghost cell)
    right = u[target + 1] if target < n - 1 else u[-1]
    current = u[target]
    # Calculate second derivative using centered scheme

Write a function performing first order strang splitting at each time step
Background
The accuracy of the splitting method discussed in the section on Ordinary Operator Splitting for ODEs can
be enhanced from $O(\Delta t)$ to $O(\Delta t^2)$ by employing Strang splitting.
This method involves taking a half-step with the $f_0$ operator, a full step with the $f_1$ operator,
and then another half-step with the $f_0$ operator.
Over a time interval $\Delta t$, the algorithm can be expressed as follows.

\begin{aligned}
\frac{d \hat{u}}{d t} & =f_0\left(\hat{u}\right), \quad \hat{u}\left(t_n\right)=u\left(t_n\right), \quad t \in\left[t_n, t_n+\frac{1}{2} \Delta t\right] \\
\frac{d \tilde{u}}{d t} & =f_1\left(\tilde{u}\right), \quad \tilde{u}\left(t_n\right)=\hat{u}\left(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}\right), \quad t \in\left[t_n, t_n+\Delta t\right] \\
\frac{d \check{u}}{d t} & =f_0\left(\check{u}\right), \quad \check{u}\left(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\right)=\tilde{u}\left(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}\right), \quad t \in\left[t_{n+\frac{1}{2}} \Delta t, t_n+\Delta t\right]
\end{aligned}
