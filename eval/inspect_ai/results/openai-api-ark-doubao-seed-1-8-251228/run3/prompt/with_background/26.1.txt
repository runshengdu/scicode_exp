PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function that determines the growth rates of each species given the resources present in the environment. The inputs are: the growth rates of the species, the preference orders of the species (pref[i, j] is the resource index of the i-th species' j-th most preferred resource (resources are indexed from 1 to R). For example, if pref[3, 0] is 2, it means the top choice for species 3 is resource 2), the resource level in the environment, and whether the species is present or not. The output would be the growth rate of each species at the moment, and a list of resources (r_temp) that each species is now consuming (r_temp[i] is the index of the resource that species i is consuming. It would be set to 0 if no resources are present or the species i is not present. )


def SpeciesGrowth(g, pref, Rs, alive):
    '''This function calcuates the species growth rate
    Inputs:
    g: growth matrix of species i on resource j. 2d float numpy array of size (N, R). 
    pref: species' preference order, 2d numpy array with dimensions [N, R] and int elements between 1 and R
    Rs: resource level in environment. 1d float numpy array of length R. 
    alive: whether the species is present or not. 1d boolean numpy array of length N. 
    Outputs: 
    g_temp: current growth rate of species, 1D float numpy array of length N. 
    r_temp: list of resources that each species is eating. 1D int numpy array of length N. 
    '''

    return g_temp, r_temp

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

import numpy as np
from math import *
from scipy.optimize import root_scalar
from scipy import special
import copy

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
