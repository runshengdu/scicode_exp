Write a Haldane model Hamiltonian on a hexagonal lattice, given the following parameters: wavevector components $k_x$ and $k_y$ (momentum) in the x and y directions, lattice spacing $a$, nearest-neighbor coupling constant $t_1$, next-nearest-neighbor coupling constant $t_2$, phase $\phi$ for the next-nearest-neighbor hopping, and the on-site energy $m$.
Background
Source: Haldane, F. D. M. (1988). Model for a quantum Hall effect without Landau levels: Condensed-matter realization of the" parity anomaly". Physical review letters, 61(18).

We denote $\{\mathbf{a}_i\}$ are the vectors from a B site to its three nearest-neighbor A sites, and $\{\mathbf{b}_i\}$ are next-nearest-neighbor distance vectors, then we have
$$
{\mathbf{a}_1} = (0,a),{\mathbf{a}_2} = (\sqrt 3 a/2, - a/2),{\mathbf{a}_3} = ( - \sqrt 3 a/2, - a/2)\\
{\mathbf{b}_1} = {\mathbf{a}_2} - {\mathbf{a}_3} = (\sqrt 3 a,0),{\mathbf{b}_2} = {\mathbf{a}_3} - {\mathbf{a}_1} = ( - \sqrt 3 a/2, - 3a/2),{\mathbf{b}_3} = {\mathbf{a}_1} - {\mathbf{a}_2} = ( - \sqrt 3 a/2,3a/2)
$$





Then the Haldane model on a hexagonal lattice can be written as
$$H(k) = {d_0}I + {d_1}{\sigma _1} + {d_2}{\sigma _2} + {d_3}{\sigma _3}$$
$${d_0} = 2{t_2}\cos \phi \sum\nolimits_i {\cos (\mathbf{k} \cdot {\mathbf{b}_i})}  = 2{t_2}\cos \phi \left[ {\cos \left( {\sqrt 3 {k_x}a} \right) + \cos \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 + 3{k_y}a/2} \right) + \cos \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - 3{k_y}a/2} \right)} \right]$$
$$
{d_1} = {t_1}\sum\nolimits_i {\cos (\mathbf{k} \cdot {\mathbf{a}_i})}  = {t_1}\left[ {\cos \left( {{k_y}a} \right) + \cos \left( {\sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - {k_y}a/2} \right) + \cos \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - {k_y}a/2} \right)} \right]\\
{d_2} = {t_1}\sum\nolimits_i {\sin (\mathbf{k} \cdot {\mathbf{a}_i})}  = {t_1}\left[ {\sin \left( {{k_y}a} \right) + \sin \left( {\sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - {k_y}a/2} \right) + \sin \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - {k_y}a/2} \right)} \right] \\
{d_3} = m - 2{t_2}\sin \phi \sum\nolimits_i {\sin (\mathbf{k} \cdot {\mathbf{b}_i})}  = m - 2{t_2}\sin \phi \left[ {\sin \left( {\sqrt 3 {k_x}a} \right) + \sin \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 + 3{k_y}a/2} \right) + \sin \left( { - \sqrt 3 {k_x}a/2 - 3{k_y}a/2} \right)} \right] \\
$$

where $\sigma_i$ are the Pauli matrices and $I$ is the identity matrix.
