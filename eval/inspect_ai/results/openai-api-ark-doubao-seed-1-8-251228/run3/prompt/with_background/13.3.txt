PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Construct the spatial differential operator a: Partial Derivative $\partial_i$. The first differential operator we want is a simple partial derivative: given an array of field values on 3d meshes, compute the partial derivates and return $\partial_x f(x,y,z)$, $\partial_y f(x,y,z)$ and $\partial_z f(x,y,z)$. We need a second order finite difference operator and on the boundary please use one-sided second-order expression.
