PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write a function to compute the initial condition as a cell-averaged approximation. This function should take the number of vertices $n$ as input. The output will be cell-averaged values, an array of length n-The numerical integral should be performed with three-point Gauss quadrature rule.
For an initial condition given by:
\begin{equation}
u_0 = \Bigg{\{}
\begin{aligned}
&\sin(x)-1 \quad -\pi/2< x \leq 0 \\
&\sin(x)+1 \quad \quad 0 < x < \pi/2\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Background:
The cell averaged value is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\bar{u} = \frac{1}{h}\int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}} u 
\end{equation}
Now approximate the initial value with the cell-averaged value.


def make_IC(n):
    '''The function computes the inital condition mentioned above
    Inputs:
    n  : number of grid points, integer
    Outputs:
    v  : cell averaged approximation of initial condition, 1d array size n-1
    '''
    # Create uniform grid vertices over the domain [-π/2, π/2]
    x = np.linspace(-np.pi/2, np.pi/2, n)
    
    # Extract left and right edges of each cell
    a = x[:-1]
    b = x[1:]
    
    # Midpoint and half-width of each cell
    c = (a + b) / 2
    d = (b - a) / 2
    
    # Three-point Gauss-Legendre nodes in the reference interval [-1, 1]
    t1 = -np.sqrt(3/5)
    t2 = 0.0
    t3 = np.sqrt(3/5)
    
    # Map reference nodes to each physical cell [a, b]
    x1 = c + d * t1
    x2 = c + d * t2
    x3 = c + d * t3
    
    # Evaluate initial condition at each Gauss point
    u1 = np.where(x1 <= 0, np.sin(x1) - 1, np.sin(x1) + 1)
    u2 = np.where(x2 <= 0, np.sin(x2) - 1, np.sin(x2) + 1)
    u3 = np.where(x3 <= 0, np.sin(x3) - 1, np.sin(x3) + 1)
    
    # Compute weighted sum for three-point Gauss quadrature
    sum_weights = (5/9) * u1 + (8/9) * u2 + (5/9) * u3
    
    # Calculate cell-averaged values: (1/h) * integral ≈ sum_weights / 2
    v = sum_weights / 2
    
    return v


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function to implement global the Lax-Friedrich numerical flux, which should take left and right cell averaged values as inputs and output the value of flux as a float. Using maximum wave speed as the global Lax-Friedrichs stability parameter, $\alpha_{LF}$.
Background:
This Lax-Fridrich numerical flux approximates the flux across a cell edge using the averaged value from the left and right cells.

\begin{equation}
LF = \frac{1}{2} (f(u_L) + f(u_R) - \alpha_{LF}\times (u_R-u_L))
\end{equation}
where the global Lax-Fridrich stabilization term $\alpha_{LF}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_{LF} = \text{max}||\frac{\partial (u^2/2)}{\partial u}|| = max||u|| = 2
\end{equation*}
$u_R$ and $u_L$ are cell averaged values on the right and left side of the vertex.

def LaxF(uL, uR):
    '''This function computes Lax-Fridrich numerical flux.
    Inputs: 
    uL : Cell averaged value at cell i, float
    uR : Cell averaged value at cell i+1, float
    Output: flux, float
    '''

    return flux
