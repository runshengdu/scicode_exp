PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Each spin site `(i, j)` has 4 nearest neighbors: `(i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1)`. To ensure periodic boundary conditions, write a Python function that returns a list of 4 nearest neighbors of a spin at site `(i, j)` in a lattice of dimension `(N, N)`.



def neighbor_list(site, N):
    '''Return all nearest neighbors of site (i, j).
    Args:
        site (Tuple[int, int]): site indices
        N (int): number of sites along each dimension
    Return:
        list: a list of 2-tuples, [(i_left, j_left), (i_above, j_above), (i_right, j_right), (i_below, j_below)]
    '''
    i, j = site
    left = (i, (j - 1) % N)
    above = ((i - 1) % N, j)
    right = (i, (j + 1) % N)
    below = ((i + 1) % N, j)
    nn_wrap = [left, above, right, below]
    return nn_wrap

Background
The magnetization is defined as the sum of all spins

\begin{align}
M &= \sum_{i} s_i.
\end{align}

Considering a periodic Ising 2D `lattice` of values 1 or -1, write a Python function that returns the acceptance probability and magnetization difference due to a spin flip at site `(i, j)` given the inverse temperature `beta`.
Background
At temperature $T$, the partition function is

\begin{align}
Z = \sum_c \exp[-\beta H(c)],
\end{align}

where $\beta = 1/T$ and $H(c)$ is the energy for a spin configuration $c$.

The probability distribution is

\begin{align}
\Pi(c) &= \frac{\exp[-\beta H(c)]}{Z}.
\end{align}

We move the configuration $c$ to $c^{\prime}$ with some probability $T( c \rightarrow c^{\prime})$. In our case, we flip a random spin, so $T( c \rightarrow c^{\prime}) = T( c^{\prime} \rightarrow c) = 1/N$. Thus, we accept the move with the probability

\begin{align}
A(c \rightarrow c^{\prime}) 
&= \min \left[1, \frac{\Pi(c^{\prime})}{\Pi(c)} \frac{T(c^{\prime} \rightarrow c)}{T(c \rightarrow c^{\prime})} \right] \\
&= \min [1, \exp(-\beta (H(c^{\prime}) - H(c)))]
\end{align}

        lattice (np.array): shape (N, N), 2D lattice of 1 and -1
        i (int): site index along x
        j (int): site index along y
        beta (float): inverse temperature

        A (float): acceptance ratio
        dM (int): change in magnetization after the spin flip
