PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Use Monte Carlo method to find the thermal equilibrium state given an inital state and given interaction coefficients $J_{ij}$. If using functions from np.random, only "randint" and "rand" are allowed in this part.
Background
Considered as the simpliest model of spin glass, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian is given by:
$$
H_{SK} = -\sum_{i < j} J_{ij}\sigma_i \sigma_j
$$
assuming the absence of a external magtetic field and full connection between all the spins.
In this Monte Carlo simulation, we should use Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to find the equilibrium state.


def find_equilibrium(spins, N, T, J, num_steps):
    '''Find the thermal euilibrium state of a given spin system
    Input:
    spins: starting spin state, 1D array of 1 and -1
    N: size of spin system, int
    T: temprature, float
    J: interaction matrix, 2D array of floats
    num_steps: number of sampling steps per spin in the Monte Carlo simulation, int
    Output:
    spins: final spin state after Monte Carlo simulation, 1D array of 1 and -1
    '''
    total_steps = num_steps * N
    for _ in range(total_steps):
        # Select random spin index
        k = np.random.randint(0, N)
        
        # Calculate sum of interactions for j < k (using column k)
        sum_j_lt_k = np.dot(J[:k, k], spins[:k])
        # Calculate sum of interactions for j > k (using row k)
        sum_j_gt_k = np.dot(J[k, k+1:], spins[k+1:])
        total_interaction = sum_j_lt_k + sum_j_gt_k
        
        # Compute energy change if we flip spin k
        delta_H = 2 * spins[k] * total_interaction
        
        # Metropolis acceptance criterion
        if delta_H <= 0:
            # Always accept favorable energy change
            spins[k] = -spins[k]
        else:
            # Compute acceptance probability for unfavorable change
            if T > 0:
                acceptance_prob = np.exp(-delta_H / T)
                # Generate random number for acceptance check
                if np.random.rand() < acceptance_prob:
                    spins[k] = -spins[k]
            # At T=0, never accept unfavorable changes
    return spins


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

In the replica method, given an emsemble of replicas at thermal equilibrium, calculate the overlaps of the replicas and return the results in ascending order.
Background
Replica symmetry breaking can be detected using the Parisi overlap fucntion. For two replicas, $R_a$ and $R_b$, the overlap between them is calculated as
$$
\frac{R_a^T\cdot R_b}{N}
$$

def calculate_overlap(replicas):
    '''Calculate all overlaps in an emsemble of replicas
    Input:
    replicas: list of replicas, list of 1D arrays of 1 and -1
    Output:
    overlaps: pairwise overlap values between all replicas, 1D array of floats, sorted
    '''

    return overlaps
