PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Suppose we translate the beam in $z$-direction, where the reexpansion process will be independent of the angular variables. Write a code to calculate the translation coeffcient ${(R|R)_{ln}^{m}({r_0})}$ of the translated beam with recursion method, where
$$R_n^m({r_p}) = \sum\limits_{l = 0}^\infty  {\sum\limits_{s =  - l}^l {(R|R)_{ln}^{m}({{r_0}})} R_l^m({r_q})},$$
where $r_0=|\mathbf{r}_p-\mathbf{r}_q|$.
Background
From the properties of Spherical Bessel Function of the First Kind, we have
$$(R|R)_{l0}^0({{r}_0}) = {( - 1)^l}\sqrt {2l + 1} {j_l}(k{{r}_0})$$
which can be used to initiate the recursion process for all $(R|R)_{lm}^m({{r}_0})$ with
$$b_{m+1}^{-m-1}(R \mid R)_{l, m+1}^{m+1}=b_l^{-m-1}(R \mid R)_{l-1, m}^m-b_{l+1}^m(R \mid R)_{l+1, m}^m, \quad l=m+1, m+2, \ldots$$Then the other matrix elements can be derived with
$$\begin{gathered}a_{n-1}^m(R \mid R)_{l, n-1}^m-a_n^m(R \mid R)_{l, n+1}^m=a_l^m(R \mid R)_{l+1, n}^m-a_{l-1}^m(R \mid R)_{l-1, n}^m, \quad l, n=0,1, \ldots, \quad m=-n, \ldots, n .\end{gathered}$$
Here the coefficients $a_n^m$ and $b_n^m$ are defined as following:
$$
a_n^m=0 \quad \text { for } n<|m| ; \quad a_n^m=a_n^{|m|}=\sqrt{\frac{(n+1+|m|)(n+1-|m|)}{(2 n+1)(2 n+3)}} \text { for } n \geqslant|m|
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& b_n^m=0 \text { for } n<|m| ; \quad b_n^m=\sqrt{\frac{(n-m-1)(n-m)}{(2 n-1)(2 n+1)}} \text { for } 0 \leqslant m \leqslant n ; \quad b_n^m=-\sqrt{\frac{(n-m-1)(n-m)}{(2 n-1)(2 n+1)}} \text { for }-n \leqslant m<0 ;
\end{aligned}
$$
