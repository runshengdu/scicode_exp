PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

We use the original MacArthur model, where the growth rate $g_i$ is given by $g_i := b_i\left(\sum_\beta c_{i\beta} w_\beta R_\beta - m_i\right)$. Write a function (SpeciesGrowth) that computes the growth rate. The inputs are: current species abundance spc, current resources level res, inverse timescale b, conversion matrix c, resource efficiency w, and species maintainance cost m. The output would be g_spc, an array of length N.
Background

def SpeciesGrowth(spc, res, b, c, w, m):
    '''This function calcuates the species growth rate
    Inputs:
    res: resource level, 1D array of length R
    b: inverse timescale of species dynamics, 1D array of length N
    c: consumer-resource conversion matrix, 2D array of shape [N, R]
    w: value/efficiency of resoruce, 1D array of length R
    m: species maintainance cost, 1D array of length N
    Outputs: 
    g_spc: growth rate of species, 1D array of length N
    '''
    # Calculate the weighted resource contribution for each species
    weighted_resource = c @ (w * res)
    # Compute net gain after subtracting maintenance cost
    net_gain = weighted_resource - m
    # Calculate growth rate using inverse timescale
    g_spc = b * net_gain
    
    return g_spc


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

We assume that while the resources are consumed by species, they also replenish logistically by themselves. Write a function (ResourcesUpdate) that computes the dynamics of the resources. The inputs are: current species abundance spc, current resources level res, conversion matrix c, inverse timescale of logistic growth r, and resource carrying capacity K. The output would be f_res, an array of length R.
Background
Here $f_\alpha := R_\alpha \left(r_\alpha(1-\frac{R_\alpha}{K_\alpha})-\sum_j c_{j\alpha}N_j\right)$ where the first term is logistic growth and the second term is consumption by species.

def ResourcesUpdate(spc, res, c, r, K):
    '''This function calculates the changing rates of resources
    Inputs:
    spc: species population, 1D array of length N
    res: resource abundance, 1D array of length R
    c: consumer-resource conversion matrix, 2D array of shape [N, R]
    r: inverse timescale of resource growth, 1D array of length R
    K: resource carrying capacity, 1D array of length R
    Outputs: 
    f_res: growth rate of resources, 1D array of length R
    '''

    return f_res

DEPENDENCIES:
Use only the following dependencies in your solution. Do not include these dependencies at the beginning of your code.

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
from functools import partial

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Now, based on the instructions and information provided above, write the complete and executable Python program for the next step in a single block.
Your response should focus exclusively on implementing the solution for the next step, adhering closely to the specified function header and the context provided by the initial steps.
Your response should NOT include the dependencies and functions of all previous steps. If your next step function calls functions from previous steps, please make sure it uses the headers provided without modification.
DO NOT generate EXAMPLE USAGE OR TEST CODE in your response. Please make sure your response python code in format of ```python```.
