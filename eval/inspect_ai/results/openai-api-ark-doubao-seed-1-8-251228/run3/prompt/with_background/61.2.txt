PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write down the matrix, $\mathbf{B}$, that transforms $(h,k,l)$ coordinates from the reciprocal lattice system to $(q_x,q_y,q_z)$ coordinates in the right-handed Cartesian system.  Let's assume they share an identical origin, with $\mathbf{\hat{x}}^*//\mathbf{\hat{a}}^*$ and $\mathbf{\hat{z}}^*//(\mathbf{\hat{a}}^* \times \mathbf{\hat{b}}^*)$. The direct lattice parameters $(a,b,c,\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ are given in units of Å and degree. Additionally, we will follow the convention $\mathbf{a_i} \cdot \mathbf{b_j} = \delta_{ij}$, with {$\mathbf{a_i}$} and {$\mathbf{b_i}$} representing the primitive vectors of crystal lattice and reciprocal lattice respectively
Background
The reciprocal lattice vectors {$\mathbf{b}_i$} are given by:
$$\mathbf{b}_i = \frac{\mathbf{a}_j\times\mathbf{a}_k}{\mathbf{a}_i\cdot(\mathbf{a}_j\times\mathbf{a}_k)}$$


def Bmat(pa):
    '''Calculate the B matrix.
    Input
    pa = (a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma)
    a,b,c: the lengths a, b, and c of the three cell edges meeting at a vertex, float in the unit of angstrom
    alpha,beta,gamma: the angles alpha, beta, and gamma between those edges, float in the unit of degree
    Output
    B: a 3*3 matrix, float
    '''
    a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma = pa
    
    # Convert angles from degrees to radians
    alpha_rad = np.radians(alpha)
    beta_rad = np.radians(beta)
    gamma_rad = np.radians(gamma)
    
    cos_alpha = np.cos(alpha_rad)
    cos_beta = np.cos(beta_rad)
    cos_gamma = np.cos(gamma_rad)
    sin_gamma = np.sin(gamma_rad)
    
    # Compute unit cell volume using lattice parameters
    sqrt_term = 1.0 - cos_alpha**2 - cos_beta**2 - cos_gamma**2 + 2 * cos_alpha * cos_beta * cos_gamma
    volume = a * b * c * np.sqrt(sqrt_term)
    
    # Construct direct lattice vectors in right-handed Cartesian coordinates
    a1 = np.array([a, 0.0, 0.0])
    a2 = np.array([b * cos_gamma, b * sin_gamma, 0.0])
    
    x = c * cos_beta
    y = (c * (cos_alpha - cos_beta * cos_gamma)) / sin_gamma
    z = volume / (a * b * sin_gamma)
    a3 = np.array([x, y, z])
    
    # Calculate reciprocal lattice vectors
    b1 = np.cross(a2, a3) / volume
    b2 = np.cross(a3, a1) / volume
    b3 = np.cross(a1, a2) / volume
    
    # Construct B matrix with reciprocal vectors as columns
    B = np.column_stack((b1, b2, b3))
    
    return B


NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write down the momentum transfer $\vec{Q} = \vec{k_s} - \vec{k_i}$ at detector pixel $(x_{det},y_{det})$ in the lab coordinate system, where $\vec{k_s}$ and $\vec{k_i}$ are scattered and incident beam respectively. In the lab coordinate, $+\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ aligns with the incident beam direction, while $+\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ points vertically upwards. Let's assume the detector plane is perpendicular to the incident beam. In the detector coordinate, $\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{det}//-\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{y}}_{det}//-\mathbf{\hat{z}}$
Background
X-ray momentum is given by:
$$k = \frac{1}{\lambda}$$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the X-ray. Here we omit the $2\pi$ factor to align with the previous convention regarding reciprocal lattice vectors

def q_cal(p, b_c, det_d, p_s, wl):
    '''Calculate the momentum transfer Q at detector pixel (x,y). Here we're employing the convention, k=1/\lambda,
    k represents the x-ray momentum and \lambda denotes the wavelength.
    Input
    p: detector pixel (x,y), a tuple of two integer
    b_c: incident beam center at detector pixel (xc,yc), a tuple of float
    det_d: sample distance to the detector, float in the unit of mm
    p_s: detector pixel size, and each pixel is a square, float in the unit of mm
    wl: X-ray wavelength, float in the unit of angstrom
    Output
    Q: a 3x1 matrix, float in the unit of inverse angstrom
    '''
