PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.



NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a function to define simple 1d linear element shape function. When etype equals to 1, it returns $\omega^1(x)$, when the type equals to 2, it returns the value of function $\omega^2(x)$ where
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\omega_i^1(x) = \frac{x-x_{i-1}}{h_{i-1}} &, \quad \quad x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_{i}\\
\omega_i^2(x) = \frac{x_{i+1}-x}{h_i}&, \quad \quad x_i\leq x \leq x_{i+1}\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Background:
The shape function of a simplest linear element is defined as following:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\omega_i^1(x) = \frac{x-x_{i-1}}{h_{i-1}} &, \quad \quad x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_{i}\\
\omega_i^2(x) = \frac{x_{i+1}-x}{h_i}&, \quad \quad x_i\leq x \leq x_{i+1}\\
N(x) = 0&, \quad \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Hence the basis function evaluated at the interior element i is
\begin{equation}
\omega_i = \omega_i^1(x) + \omega_i^2(x)
\end{equation}
wheras for the boundary nodes $i=1,n+1$ we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\omega_1(x) &= \omega_1^2(x) =  \frac{x_2-x}{h_1}\\
\omega_{n+1} &= \omega_{n+1}^1(x) = \frac{x-x_n}{h_n}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Now write a function respresenting such simple linear element,
which takes five inputs 
- The index of element i.
- An array containing coordinates of nodal degree of freedom (mesh)
- An integer of the total number of the nodal degree of freedom
- An real number of element size
- An integer serving as a indicator, which indicates the type of basis function. When type equals to 1, 
it returns $\omega^1(x)$, when the type equals to 2, it returns the value of function $\omega^2(x)$.

def basis(i, p, M, h, etype):
    '''Inputs
    i: int, the index of element
    p: array of arbitrary size 1,2, or 3, the coordinates
    M: int, the total number of the nodal dofs
    h: int, the element size
    etype: int, basis function type; When type equals to 1, 
    it returns $\omega^1(x)$, when the type equals to 2, it returns the value of function $\omega^2(x)$.
    Outputs
    v: array of size 1,2, or 3, value of basis function
    '''

    return v
