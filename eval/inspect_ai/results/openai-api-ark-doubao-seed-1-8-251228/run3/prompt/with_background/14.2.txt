PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You will be provided with problem steps along with background knowledge necessary for solving the problem. Your task will be to develop a Python solution focused on the next step of the problem-solving process.

PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Implement a python function to employ Mannella's leapfrog method to solve the Langevin equation of a microsphere optically trapped in the gas with the given initial condition.
Background
For a microsphere trapped in the gas, we have the following Langevin equation:
  $$\frac{{{d^2}x}}{{d{t^2}}} + \frac{{dx}}{{dt}}/{\tau _p} + \omega _0^2x = \sqrt {\frac{2}{{{\tau _p}}}} {v_{rms}}\zeta (t),$$
where $\omega_0$ is the resonant frequency of the optical trap, $\tau_p$ is the momentum relaxation time of the particle, $v_{rms}$ is the root mean square velocity of the particle and $\zeta(t)$ is a normalized white-noise process. This stochastic differential equation can be rewritten as:
\begin{array}{l}
v = \frac{{dx}}{{dt}}\\
\frac{{dv}}{{dt}} =  - v/{\tau _p} - \omega _0^2x + \sqrt {\frac{2}{{{\tau _p}}}} {v_{rms}}\zeta (t)
\end{array}

Mannella’s leapfrog method with step-size $\Delta t$ defined as:
\begin{array}{l}
{x_{n + 1/2}} = {x_n} + {v_n}\Delta t/2,\\
{v_{n + 1}} = ({v_n} - {v_n}\Delta t/(2{\tau _p}) - \omega _0^2{x_{n + 1/2}}\Delta t + \sqrt {\frac{2}{{{\tau _p}}}} {v_{rms}}\Delta W)/(1 + \Delta t/(2{\tau _p}),\\
{x_{n + 1}} = {x_{n + 1/2}} + {v_{n + 1}}\Delta t/2,
\end{array}
where $\Delta W$ is sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\sqrt{\Delta t}$.

NEXT STEP - PROBLEM STEP AND FUNCTION HEADER:
This part will describe the next step in the problem-solving process. A function header will be provided, and your task is to develop the Python code for this next step based on the provided description and function header.

Write a code to calculate the mean-square displacement at a given time point $t_0$ of an optically trapped microsphere in a gas with Mannella’s leapfrog method, by averaging Navg simulations. The simulation step-size should be smaller than $t_0/steps$ and the initial position and velocity of the microsphere follow the Maxwell distribution.
Background:
The initial condition $(x_0,v_0)$ of the stochastic differential equation should also follow a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $v_{rms}$ for the velocity and $x_{rms}=v_{rms}/\omega_0$. The mean-square displacement can be then calculated as ${x_{MSD}} = \left\langle {{{(x({t_0}) - {x_0})}^2}} \right\rangle$, averaged over Navg different initial conditions.
