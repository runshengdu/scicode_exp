Implement a python function to employ Mannella's leapfrog method to solve the Langevin equation of a microsphere optically trapped in the gas with the given initial condition.
Background
For a microsphere trapped in the gas, we have the following Langevin equation:
  $$\frac{{{d^2}x}}{{d{t^2}}} + \frac{{dx}}{{dt}}/{\tau _p} + \omega _0^2x = \sqrt {\frac{2}{{{\tau _p}}}} {v_{rms}}\zeta (t),$$
where $\omega_0$ is the resonant frequency of the optical trap, $\tau_p$ is the momentum relaxation time of the particle, $v_{rms}$ is the root mean square velocity of the particle and $\zeta(t)$ is a normalized white-noise process. This stochastic differential equation can be rewritten as:
\begin{array}{l}
v = \frac{{dx}}{{dt}}\\
\frac{{dv}}{{dt}} =  - v/{\tau _p} - \omega _0^2x + \sqrt {\frac{2}{{{\tau _p}}}} {v_{rms}}\zeta (t)
\end{array}

Mannella’s leapfrog method with step-size $\Delta t$ defined as:
\begin{array}{l}
{x_{n + 1/2}} = {x_n} + {v_n}\Delta t/2,\\
{v_{n + 1}} = ({v_n} - {v_n}\Delta t/(2{\tau _p}) - \omega _0^2{x_{n + 1/2}}\Delta t + \sqrt {\frac{2}{{{\tau _p}}}} {v_{rms}}\Delta W)/(1 + \Delta t/(2{\tau _p}),\\
{x_{n + 1}} = {x_{n + 1/2}} + {v_{n + 1}}\Delta t/2,
\end{array}
where $\Delta W$ is sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\sqrt{\Delta t}$.
