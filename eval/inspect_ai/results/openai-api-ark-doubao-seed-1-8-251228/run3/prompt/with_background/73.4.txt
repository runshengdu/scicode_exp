PROBLEM STEPS AND FUNCTION CODE:
Here, you'll find the Python code for the initial steps of the problem-solving process. This code is integral to building the solution.

Write down the matrix, $\mathbf{B}$, that transforms $(h,k,l)$ coordinates from the reciprocal lattice system to $(q_x,q_y,q_z)$ coordinates in the right-handed Cartesian system.  Let's assume they share an identical origin, with $\mathbf{\hat{x}}^*//\mathbf{\hat{a}}^*$ and $\mathbf{\hat{z}}^*//(\mathbf{\hat{a}}^* \times \mathbf{\hat{b}}^*)$. The direct lattice parameters $(a,b,c,\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ are given in units of Å and degree. Additionally, we will follow the convention $\mathbf{a_i} \cdot \mathbf{b_j} = \delta_{ij}$, with {$\mathbf{a_i}$} and {$\mathbf{b_i}$} representing the primitive vectors of crystal lattice and reciprocal lattice respectively [<u>duplicate Xray_conversion-I step </u>]
Background
The reciprocal lattice vectors {$\mathbf{b}_i$} are given by:
$$\mathbf{b}_i = \frac{\mathbf{a}_j\times\mathbf{a}_k}{\mathbf{a}_i\cdot(\mathbf{a}_j\times\mathbf{a}_k)}$$

The detector plane has roll, pitch, and yaw angles. In the lab coordinate system, yaw $\Psi$ represents rotation along the $+\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ axis, pitch $\Theta$ along the $+\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ axis, and roll $\Phi$ along the $+\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ axis, with the rotation sequence as yaw $\rightarrow$ pitch $\rightarrow$ roll. Write down the momentum transfer $\vec{Q} = \vec{k_s} - \vec{k_i}$ at detector pixel $(x_{det},y_{det})$ in the lab coordinate system, where $\vec{k_s}$ and $\vec{k_i}$ are scattered and incident beam respectively. In the lab coordinate, $+\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ aligns with the incident beam direction, while $+\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ points vertically upwards. In the detector coordinate, $\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{det}//-\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{y}}_{det}//-\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ if detector plane is normal to the incident beam

In a four-circle diffractometer with a fixed area-detector, we have three degrees of freedom to rotate the sample: $\phi$, $\chi$ and $\theta$. When $\phi$ = $\chi$ = $\theta$ = 0, the rotation axes for these angles are along $+\mathbf{\hat{z}}$, $+\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ and $-\mathbf{\hat{y}}$, respetively. The rotation sequence is $\phi$ $\rightarrow$ $\chi$ $\rightarrow$ $\theta$. During experiments, we rotate $\theta$ at fixed $\phi$ and $\chi$, capturing a diffraction pattern snapshot at each frame. For two non-parallel Bragg reflections, denoted as the primary $(h_1,k_1,l_1)$ and secondary $(h_2,k_2,l_2)$ reflections, we observe corresponding peaks on the detector at positions $(x_1,y_1)$ in frame $z_1$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in frame $z_2$. Write down the orthogonal unit-vector triple {$\mathbf{\hat{t}}_i^c$}, where $\mathbf{\hat{t}}_1^c//q_1$, $\mathbf{\hat{t}}_3^c//(q_1 \times q_2)$ and $q_i$ represents the Bragg reflection in Cartesian coordiantes. Similarly, write down {$\mathbf{\hat{t}}_i^g$}, where $\mathbf{\hat{t}}_1^g//Q_1$, $\mathbf{\hat{t}}_3^g//(Q_1 \times Q_2)$ and $Q_i$ represents the momentum transfer before rotating the crystal.
Background
The diffractometer rotation matrix is defined as $\mathbf{G} = R_{\mathbf{\hat{y}}}(-\theta)R_{\mathbf{\hat{x}}}(\chi)R_{\mathbf{\hat{z}}}(\phi)$

Write down the orientation matrix $\mathbf{U}$ as the unitary transformation from the bases {$\mathbf{\hat{t}}_i^c$} to {$\mathbf{\hat{t}}_i^g$}
Background
To orient the crystal, we determine the directions of the reciprocal lattice primitive vectors in the lab coordinate system. We define the Cartesian coordinate system in reciprocal space to be the same as the lab coordinate system.  Our goal is to rotate the reciprocal lattice so that it aligns with our observed diffraction pattern. The rotation matrix used for this purpose is the orientation matrix $\mathbf{U}$, given by:
$$\mathbf{T}_g = \mathbf{U}\mathbf{T}_c$$
where $\mathbf{T}_c$ represents the matrix with columns {$\mathbf{\hat{t}}_i^c$} and similarly for $\mathbf{T}_g$.
